# 1. Who Is God?

## 1.1 God Reveals Himself

- Activity: Two Truths and One Lie

**Secrets**
- Has anyone ever kept a secret from you?
- No matter how much you might want to know the secret, until someone tells you, you just cannot know what it is.
- It’s the same way with knowing who God is.

### God has made himself known to everyone in 2 ways
1. **Creation**: “the word he has made”
	- Ps 19:1–2, Rom 1:19–20
	- Think with me what are some of the qualities of God that we can see by looking at different parts of the world
		- Flower, stars in the night sky, music
	- Job 38:4–11
2. **Conscience**: “God has made us with a deep inner understanding of things that are right and things that are wrong.”
	- When we lie to our parents, we can tell inside us that this is wrong to do.
	- Rom 2:14–15

## 1.2 God Speaks

- But God did not just make himself known through his actions. God has also spoken.
- The Bible is where we read what God says.
- 2 Tim 3:16–17
	- “all” of Scripture, not just part of it
	- “breathed out by God” - the Bible comes from God’s own mouth.
- 1 Thes 2:13
	- the Bible really is “the word of God.”
- 2 Pet 1:20–21
	- the human authors of Scripture were “carried along by the Holy Spirit” as they wrote.
- Since God has spoken to us through the Bible, we should read, study, memorize, meditate, and apply God’s word.

## 1.3 Aseity of God

**Activity: Emergency Preparedness**
List all the things that you would bring if you needed to live on a deserted island for 7 days.

**What Do You Need To Live?**
- food, water, clothing, shelter (home)
- family, friends, police, doctors, plumbers
- books, teachers, money, job
- We need God, but what does God need? 

### God Does Not Need His Creation
- God does not need anything.
	- We need God, and we need many things.
	- Acts 17:24-25
- Nothing can be added to him. 
	- We can gain friends, money, strength, skills. But without God, we have nothing.
	- Jam 1:17
	- God possesses everything that is good. Any good that creation possesses comes from God.
- God is unique. There is none like Him. God is not lonely. His creation adds nothing to His greatness and goodness. He does not derive his power and being from something else. This attribute is called God’s aseity.

## 1.4 God Came Near Us
- Isa 57:15
- Although God is “high and lifted up,” he also chose to dwell among the “contrite and lowly spirit.”
- God chose to come to us not because He needed us. Rather, we need God to “revive the heart of the contrite.”
- When a husband and wife love each other, they both have needs that the other people can meet.
- God does not have needs. His love for His creation is completely unselfish.
	- Rom 5:8
	- 1 John 4:10
- God came to us despite our sin through Jesus. Jesus is perfect and sinless. He died on the cross and took our place, paying the penalty of death that we deserved to pay.
	- 2 Cor 5:21
- When we turn away from our sin and trust in Jesus, God promises to forgive us.
	- Rom 6:23

## 1.5 God Is Great

**Activity #1: "I am the greatest..."**
- Write down two things that you can do that no one else in this room can do.
- Ex: I can drive a car. I can work as a doctor and help people who are sick get well.

God has several important attributes that are unique to Him alone. No other created thing has these incommunicable attributes.

### A. God Is Eternal
- God's life had no beginning. He has no end.
- There is nothing else that is eternal. 
- We all had a beginning. We each have a birthday.
- God doesn't have a birthday. God had no beginning, and he has no end.
- Ps 90:1-2

### B. God Is Holy
- What does it mean to be holy?
	- To be holy means to be different from anything else.
- There is no one like God. God is unique. He is separate. He is set apart.
- Exod 15:11
- God is holy and separate from everything that is wrong, impure, and sinful.
	- God is *truth*. There is no falsehood in God.
	- God is *faithful*. He cannot break His promises.
	- God is *righteous*. He cannot do evil.

### C. God Never Changes (Immutable)
- God is perfect. He never changes.
- He cannot get better.
- He cannot get worse.
- Ps 102:25-27

The things that make God great are called his **incommunicable** attributes.
  
## 1.6 God Is Good

Activity #2: "What I can teach you?"
- Write down one skill that you have that you can teach us and help us develop.
- I make a delicious split pea soup, and I can teach you how to make it.

God also has some attributes and characteristics that he can help us develop. We will never be perfect like God, but we can strive to be like him.

### A. God is perfectly wise

- Rom 16:27
- Knowledge is storing information in your brain. 
	- You can have knowledge without wisdom.
- Wisdom is using knowledge and applying it to solve a problem and fulfill a good purpose. 
	- Someone who is cunning uses knowledge to do evil things.
	- Someone who is wise applies knowledge to do what is good, helpful, and right.
- God knows everything that can be known.
	- God is also perfectly wise, and He decides everything perfectly and brings about all things to work for the best.
	- God's wisdom is displayed in His creation, His work of salvation, and Jesus' death on the cross.

### B. God is Infinitely Powerful

- Not only is God perfectly wise, but He is also almighty in His power.
- Jer 32:17

### C. God Is Perfectly Good
- It's hard for us to understand when someone is perfectly good.
- Part of God's goodness is His love for people in spite of their sin. 
- God shows us grace and mercy.
	- Grace is kindness given to those who deserve punishment.
	- Mercy is kindness given to those who are helpless.
- Illustration: Loving your sibling when they sin?
- Eph 2:4-5
