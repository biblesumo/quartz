# Executive Summary: Big Truths for Small Hearts

## 1. Who Is God?

We can only know God because He has revealed Himself to us.  We cannot discover God on our own.  God is too big.  Until God decides to show us who He is, we cannot know anything about Him.  Thankfully, God has revealed himself.

### 1.1 God Reveals Himself

God has revealed Himself to us in two ways.  

#### 1. God revealed Himself through what He has made

> The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.  Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge. (Psalm 19:1-2)

> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.  For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.  So they are without excuse. (Romans 1:19-20)

> Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?  Tell me, if you have understanding.  Who determined its measurements—surely you know!  Or who stretched the line upon it?  On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb, when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band, and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors, and said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed’? (Job 38:4-11)

Through observing the created world, we can learn about God’s greatness and glory.  Be amazed at the intricate details of our human body.  God is truly wise and powerful.

#### 2. God revealed Himself through our conscience

God has given us a conscience that tells us that there are things that are right and wrong.  We know at a young age that lying is wrong, and obeying our parents is right.  God has placed this inner understanding in our hearts.

> For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.  They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them. (Romans 2:14-15)

### 1.2 God Speaks

God revealed himself through his creation that we see and experience.  He created our conscience to evaluate what is right and wrong.  But God did not stay silent.  God also speaks.

> And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. (Genesis 1:3)

In Genesis 1:6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24 and 26, “God said” is used 7 times.  God speaks, and His words are powerful and active.

Today, God speaks to us through the Bible.

> All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16-17)

All the Bible is God’s word, and what He wants us to know is contained in the Bible. 

> And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers. (1 Thessalonians 2:13)

Even though the Bible was written by human hands, it was God that was working in them.  The Bible is the inspired word of God.

> Knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation.  For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:20-21)

The Holy Spirit moved the authors to write the words of the Bible.  Because the Bible is the word of God, it is useful and profitable for our growth.

We perceive some things about God through His creation, but because God has spoken, we can learn so much more about him by studying his word, the Bible.

### 1.3 God Does Not Need His Creation

> The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. (Acts 17:24-25)

God does not need anything, and nothing can be added to him.  God has everything.  God gives His creation what it needs.  Creation cannot give anything to God because God lacks nothing.

> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. (James 1:17)

God possesses everything that is good.  Any good that creation possesses comes from God.  

> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance? (Isaiah 40:12)

God is unique.  God is great.  There is none like Him.   

God is not lonely.  God did not need to create man.  His creation adds nothing to His greatness and goodness.

### 1.4 God Came Near Us

> For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: “I dwell in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly, and to revive the heart of the contrite. (Isaiah 57:15)

God is “high and lifted up.”  He also chose to dwell among the “contrite and lowly spirit,” namely us.  He chose to come to us not because He needed us.  God does not need us, but we need God.  We need God to “revive the heart of the contrite.”

God’s love is different from anything in our world.  When a husband and wife love each other, they both have needs that the other person can meet.  God does not have needs.  His love for His creation is completely unselfish. 

> “God’s love is bottomlessly selfless, by very definition; it has everything to give and nothing to receive.” (The Problem of Pain, C.S. Lewis)

> But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)

In spite of our sin and inability to offer Him any benefit, God loves.  

> In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. (1 John 4:10)

God came to us despite our sin through His Son Jesus Christ.  Jesus, who was perfect and sinless, died on the cross.  Jesus took our place, paying the penalty of death that we deserved to pay.

> For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. (2 Corinthians 5:21)

When we turn away from our sin and trust in Jesus’ death as a payment for our sin, God promises to forgive us and make us clean. 

> For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23)

### 1.5 God Is Great

#### 1. God is eternal

God’s life had no beginning.  He has no end.  There is nothing else that is eternal.  We are all created beings, and we had a origin and beginning.  God is unique.  God had no beginning.  He has no end.

> Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. (Psalm 90:1-2)

God is self-existent.  He has life in Himself.  God is also self-sufficient.  He has everything necessary for life in Himself.  

#### 2. God is holy

To be holy means to be different than anything else.  There is no one like God.  God is unique.  He is separate.  He is set apart.

> And one called to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!”  (Isaiah 6:3)

> Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?  Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders? (Exodus 15:11)

God is holy and separate from everything that is wrong, impure and sinful.  God cannot be any less than who He is as God.  Because God is truth, there is no falsehood in God.  Because God is faithful, He cannot recant on His word.  Because God is righteous, He cannot do evil.  God cannot tolerate or accept the evil done by others. 

#### 3. God never changes

Because God is perfect, He does not change.  He cannot get better.  He cannot get worse.  

> Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment.  You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away, but you are the same, and your years have no end. (Psalm 102:25-27)

### 1.6 God Is Good

#### 1. God is perfectly wise

> To the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ! Amen. (Romans 16:27)

**Knowledge** is storing information in your brain.  You can acquire knowledge without wisdom.

**Wisdom** is using knowledge and applying it to solving a problem.  Wisdom applies knowledge to plan for the future.  Wisdom is using knowledge for a particular purpose.

Someone who is cunning uses knowledge to accomplish something that is evil.  Wisdom is applying knowledge to accomplish what is good, helpful, and right.

God has all knowledge.  God knows everything that can be known.  Guided by His holy and righteous nature and His perfect knowledge, God decides everything perfectly and brings about all things to work for the best. 

> O Lord, how manifold are your works!  In wisdom have you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.  (Psalm 104:24)

> For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”  Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.  For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. (1 Corinthians 1:18-25)

God’s wisdom was manifested in His creation, His work of salvation, and Jesus’ death on the cross.

#### 2. God is infinitely powerful

The God of the Bible is both perfectly wise and almighty in His power.  

> The Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’ Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.” (Genesis 18:13-14)

> Ah, Lord God! It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you. (Jeremiah 32:17)

#### 3. God is perfectly good

Because we are sinners, we can have difficulty understanding when someone is perfectly good.  Our God is perfectly good.  His life, character, and actions are completely good.

> For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you. (Psalm 5:4)

> You are good and do good; teach me your statutes. (Psalm 119:68)

Part of God’s goodness is His love for people in spite of their sin.  God longs for His people to be blessed. God desires to extend grace and mercy.  Grace is kindness given to those who deserve punishment.  Mercy is kindness given to those who are hopeless and helpless.

> And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.  But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us… For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. (Ephesians 2:1-4, 8-9)

God shows His love, goodness, and grace when He sent Jesus to pay for our sin and restore our relationship with Him.

The triad of God’s wisdom, power, and goodness makes Him worthy of our worship.  There is none like Him.


## 2. What Is the Trinity?

The concept of the Trinity is a non-negotiable doctrine of the Christian faith.  

Some people think Christians believe in three gods.  This is tritheism which is untrue.  Others think Christians believe in a contradiction, the idea that one can also be three (1=3).  This is not true either.

Simply put, the trinity is affirming that **God is one in essence and three in person**.   

### 2.1 There Is Only One God

From the very beginning in Genesis 1:1, the Bible teaches us that there is only one God (monotheism).

> In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. (Genesis 1:1)

- There is one and only one God.
- This one God made absolutely everything.
- Because God has made everything, He alone has rightful rulership over everything that exists.

The one and only God is the creator of the universe, and He has the title of Creator and Lord.  From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible speaks that our creator God is only one God.  There is no other.

> Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. (Deuteronomy 6:4)

> That all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God; there is no other. (1 King 8:60)

> And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. (John 17:3)

The Bible is clear.  There is one and only one God.

### 2.2 One God in Three Persons

This is one of the hardest Christian doctrines to understand.  But it is important to understand this for two reasons.  

- This is who God really is.
- Seeing God as one in essence and three in persons allows us to understand the ways in which the Father, Son and Holy Spirit relate to one another and do their work.

We do not encounter the complete teaching of God’s triune nature in Genesis.  There are hints of it early in the Old Testament.  But we do not have the full disclosure of the trinitarian character of God until the New Testament.  

The Bible speaks that God is three persons. 
- The Father is God
- The Son is God
- The Holy Spirit is God.  

> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (Matthew 28:19-20)

The word “name” in Matthew 28:19 is singular, not plural.  There is only one God, and one essence of God as indicated by His one “name.”  God’s name, however, has three parts:  Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. (2 Corinthians 13:14)

[[Paul]] knows there is only one God, but he uses the language of three in this blessing that he offers from the one God.

> For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. (Ephesians 2:18)

All who trust in Christ Jesus and His work are able to come to the Father through the Spirit.  So Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all involved in the way a person approaches God.

All examples, analogies, and illustrations are inadequate to help us understand how God is both one and three.

The Bible teaches that there is one God, and the Father is fully God, the Son is fully God, and the Holy Spirit is fully God - not three gods but three Persons, each of whom expresses fully that one God.

We must believe this even though we may not understand it completely.

### 2.3 The Father Is God

> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. (John 3:16-17)

The Father planned our salvation and sent His Son to save us from our sin.  

> Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.  And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (Philippians 2:5-8)

The Son (not the Father) became a man to live a perfect life and die on the cross.  The Holy Spirit worked to help Jesus during His life (see Luke 4:14-21).

The Bible teaches that the Father planned everything that takes place in all of creation.

> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places…In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will. (Ephesians 1:3,11)

The final praise for salvation is directed to the Father.  [[Paul]] praises the Father for our blessings.  These blessings are made possible through the work of the Son.

> And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.  Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (Philippians 2:8-11)

> For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.  The last enemy to be destroyed is death.  For “God has put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him.  When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all. (1 Corinthians 15:25-28)

The Father is described as the One highest in charge.  This helps us in how we pray.  Jesus instructed us to pray to the Father.  We pray to the Father because He has the highest authority of all.  

> Pray then like this: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.” (Matthew 6:9)

Even Jesus is sitting to the right hand of God the Father, indicating that the Father is highest of all.

> That he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places. (Ephesians 1:20)

We can come to the Father because of what Christ has done for us through His death and resurrection.  So our prayers are to the Father in the name and authority of the Son by the power of the Holy Spirit.

> For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. (Ephesians 2:18)

### 2.4 The Son Is God

Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of the Father who came down from heaven to take on full human nature.  He is fully God and fully man.  

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John 1:1,14)

There are many places in the New Testament that refer to Jesus as God.

> Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my **God**!” (John 20:28)

> To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is **God** over all, blessed forever. Amen. (Romans 9:5)

> Who, though he was in the form of **God**, did not count equality with **God** a thing to be grasped, (Philippians 2:6)

> He is the image of the invisible **God**, the firstborn of all creation. (Colossians 1:15)

> Waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great **God** and Savior Jesus Christ. (Titus 2:13)

> But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O **God**, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. (Hebrews 1:8)

> Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our **God** and Savior Jesus Christ. (2 Peter 1:1)

> And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true **God** and eternal life. (1 John 5:20)

Jesus can do things that only God can do.
- Jesus created the universe. (John 1:3; Colossians 1:16)
- Jesus forgives sins. (Mark 2:1-12)
- Jesus is eternal, and He never changes.  (Isaiah 9:6; Micah 5:2; Hebrews 1:10-12; 13:8; Revelation 1:8)  
- Jesus is worshipped as God.  (John 20:28; Philippians 2:9-11; Hebrews 1:6; Revelation 5:8-14)  The Bible is clear that only God can be worshipped.  (Exodus 20:1-5; 34:14; Deuteronomy 6:13)
- Jesus declared that He is God. (John 8:58; Exodus 8:14)

### 2.5 The Holy Spirit Is God

God is spirit. (see John 4:24)  And the third person of the Trinity is called the “Spirit” or “Holy Spirit.”  

The Holy Spirit is a real, genuine person.  The Holy Spirit can be lied to and insulted and outraged.

> But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?” (Acts 5:3)

> How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? (Hebrews 10:29)

#### The Holy Spirit has a mind, a will and emotions.

> These things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.  For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. (1 Corinthians 2:10-11)

> All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills. (1 Corinthians 12:11)

> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. (Ephesians 4:30)

#### The Holy Spirit is God

> But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?  While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to **God**. (Acts 5:3-4)

> Do you not know that you are **God's** temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? (1 Corinthians 3:16)

#### The Holy Spirit can do things only God can do.

> The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. (Genesis 1:2)

> Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the **Spirit**, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.  That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” (John 3:5-6)

> He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the **Holy Spirit**. (Titus 3:5)

> And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the **Spirit**, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. (1 Corinthians 2:13)

> For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the **Holy Spirit**. (2 Peter 1:21)

#### The Holy Spirit has qualities that are only true of God.

> How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the **eternal** Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. (Hebrews 9:14)

> Where shall I go from your Spirit?  Or where shall I flee from your presence?  If I ascend to heaven, you are there!  If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!  If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me. (Psalm 139:7-10)

#### The Holy Spirit is equal to God the Father and God the Son.

> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19)

### 2.6 How the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit Relate

The one God does most everything through all three Persons of the Trinity.  Each person does his own distinctive work.  They work in harmony with each other as each person fulfills that part of the overall work that is right and good for him to do.

**The Father stands atop this work as the One who designs and plans what the work shall be.**  The Father plans the work that should take place.  He determines how the Son and Spirit should join him in carrying out this work. 

The Son is completely committed to doing the will of the Father.  

> Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.” (John 4:34)

> So Jesus said to them, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me.  And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.” (John 8:28-29)

**As the Son of the Father, Jesus lives always under the authority of his Father — in eternity past and now and in eternity future.** When all things are put under the authority of the Son, the Son will put himself under the Father’s authority along with all of creation, in order for God the Father to be shown as supreme.

> For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.  The last enemy to be destroyed is death.  For “God has put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him.  When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all. (1 Corinthians 15:25-28)

**The Spirit is under the authority of the Father and the Son.** The Spirit delights in showing Jesus off, shining the spotlight on Jesus, and helping people see just how wonderful Jesus is.

> I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.  When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.  He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. (John 16:13-14)

### 2.7 Final Thoughts

The relation of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, then, is one of glorious harmony. Each has his work to contribute, and each does this in recognition of the authority and submission order that is true among these Persons.  The Father, Son, and Spirit are fully equal as God, yet they live gladly within lines of authority.

The doctrine of the Trinity is essential to the Christian gospel.  To know “what is the trinity” is to understand our great God for who He really is, one in essence and three in persons.

## 3. Who Made the World?
### 3.1 God (the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) Made the World

God made everything without using any materials that were already there.  Before God created the universe, there was nothing else beside God Himself. God created everything out of nothing, and he created by speaking into existence everything that has come to be.

> “By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.” (Hebrews 11:3)

In the New Testament, God is Son is the One who actually brought the world into being.

> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  He was in the beginning with God.  All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.” (John 1:1-3)

> “For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.” (Colossians 1:16)

> “Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, 2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.” (Hebrews 1:1-2)

> “Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.” (1 Corinthians 8:6)

The Father is responsible for all of creation since it all comes “from” him.  But the Son, Jesus Christ, is the One “through whom” the Father created the world. The Father spoke, and his Word brought the universe into being.

> Even though we are not told much in the Bible about this, we know that the Spirit was involved with the Father and the Son in creation. (Genesis 1:2, 2:7; Psalm 33:6; John 1:1-3)

**God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit made the earth.**  All three persons are involved in our salvation, and all three persons were involved in our creation.

### 3.2 God Rules the World He Has Made

Because God created everything, He also owns everything.  God is the rightful owner of everything, and He is also the rightful ruler of everything.

> “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.”  (Revelation 4:11)

#### God provides for everything he has made.

> “Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?” (Matthew 6:26)

#### God directs the world to accomplish everything that He has planned for it.

> “In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will” (Ephesians 1:11)

> “At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation; all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, “What have you done?” (Daniel 4:34-35)

### 3.3 God Provides All the Good Things in the World

Every benefit that we receive comes from God Himself.

> “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name!  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.”  (Psalm 103:1-5)

> “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.” (James 1:17)

All that the Father gives us, he gives to us through what Christ has done, and never apart from this.  God forgives our sins through the death of Christ.  God gives us hope for eternal life through the resurrection of Christ.  God provides for our needs through the riches of Christ.  

> “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.” (Ephesians 1:3)

We should not doubt God’s love and His intention to want our best.  God is for us.

> “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?  He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?” (Romans 8:31-32)

God will give His children everything that God knows will truly and eternally be good for them.

> “The young lions suffer want and hunger; but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.” (Psalm 34:10)

> “For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor.  No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly.”  (Psalm 84:11)

Our proper response to God’s generosity and grace is thanksgiving.

> “When he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went they were cleansed.  Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan.  Then Jesus answered, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?” (Luke 17:14-17)

> “For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him.” (Romans 1:21a)

The opposite of thankfulness is grumbling, which is utterly sinful.  

> “Nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.” (1 Corinthians 10:10)

### 3.4 God Controls All the Bad Things in the World

God is just as much in control of bad things that happen in the world as he’s in control of all of the good that takes place. 

> “See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.” (Deuteronomy 32:39)

> “The Lord kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.  The Lord makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts.” (1 Samuel 2:6-7)

> “I am the Lord, and there is no other, besides me there is no God; I equip you, though you do not know me, that people may know, from the rising of the sun and from the west, that there is none besides me; I am the Lord, and there is no other.  I form light and create darkness, I make well-being and create calamity, I am the Lord, who does all these things.”  (Isaiah 45:5-7)

The one and only true God is in complete control of everything, all that is good and all that is bad.

Some people cannot understand how God could control bad things and not be blamed for that bad.  The Bible teaches that while God controls all things good and bad, God himself is good, and he is not bad at all.

> “This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.” (1 John 1:5)

> “For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you.” (Psalm 5:4)

A word often used when explaining these ideas is the word sovereignty.  To say that God rules over all things, both the good and the bad, is to say that he is completely sovereign over them.

It is only because God has complete control over all bad things that we can be sure that those bad things work to bring about some good purpose that God has planned.  If God is not in control of bad things, then we would be led to deep sadness, thinking that a bad thing that is happening will serve no good purpose.

### 3.5 Our Responsibility in the World God Controls

Wicked people carry out things to harm others and to bring about what is wrong.  God works through those very wicked actions to bring about his good purposes. The wicked people who have done these bad things are rightly guilty of doing what was wrong.  But God, who works through what they have done, is worthy of praise since he brings about the good that he has planned through them.

The story of Joseph illustrates several truths. (Genesis 37-50)

#### Joseph’s jealous brothers sold Joseph into Egypt.
#### God was involved in sending Joseph to Egypt. (Genesis 45:5-7)
#### God had the highest responsibility for sending Joseph to Egypt.  (Genesis 45:8)
#### Joseph’s brothers were to blame for what they did, but God should be praised. (Genesis 50:20)

Wicked people, the Jewish leaders and Roman soldiers, were involved in putting Jesus on the cross.  But we also must say that God the Father put Jesus on the cross to die.

> “Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for guilt, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.” (Isaiah 53:10)

> “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)

**God is sovereign and in control.  We are responsible and accountable for the actions we do.** The Bible helps us see that these two things must be kept together.  Although we cannot understand this fully, we  must believe both of these teachings of the Bible are true. 

### 3.6 Pain and Suffering in the World God Controls

#### Suffering is not something good that lasts forever.

God’s original creation was good and only good.

> “And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.” (Genesis 1:31)

In heaven that is coming, all evil, suffering, and pain will be done away with completely.

> “Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.”  (Revelation 22:1-5)

#### Suffering is often planned and used by God to bring about good.

- Suffering can sometimes be God’s tool for judgment to those that oppose Him. (Numbers 16:31-50; Isaiah 10:5-19)
- Suffering can sometimes be God’s tool to call back disobedient children. (Proverbs 3:12; Hebrews 12:10)
- Suffering can sometimes be God’s tool to help believers grow their faith in God. (Romans 5:3-5; James 1:2-4)
- Suffering can sometimes be God’s tool to show our human weakness so God’s strength and glory might be displayed. (2 Corinthians 4:8-12, 12:8-10)  
- Suffering can sometimes be God’s tool to allow believers to better help others who have experienced similar suffering.  (2 Corinthians 1:3-7)
- Suffering is part of being a follower of Jesus, being willing to suffer for His sake. (Matthew 5:10-12; John 15:18-20; Philippians 3:10; 2 Timothy 3:12)

#### God has promised His children that everything in their lives, including suffering, will be used for their good.

> “And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.” (Romans 8:28)

God commands us to give Him thanks in our suffering.

> “Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.” (1 Thessalonians 5:18)

> “Giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Ephesians 5:20)

#### God is more concerned with our character than with our comfort, with our holiness rather than our happiness.

> “Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.” (James 1:2-4)

> “Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.” (Romans 5:3-5)

#### We should pray for God to remove our suffering while we pray for God to help us accept our suffering.

> “So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” (2 Corinthians 12:7-10)

### 3.7 Summary of Our Sovereign Creator

God created everything out of nothing.  All three persons of the Trinity were involved in creation.  Because God created everything, he rules over everything also.  He is our sovereign creator.

Every good thing in this life comes from God.  God is in control of everything that is good and everything that is evil.  While God controls all things good and bad, God himself is good, and he is not bad at all.

God is sovereign and in control, and we are responsible and accountable for all our actions.  Evildoers are rightly guilty, and God is deserving of all praise.

God does use suffering for His good.  Suffering will not last forever.  God will create a new heaven and earth that will be free from all pain and suffering. 

## 4. Our Human Nature and Our Sin
### 4.1 God’s Masterpiece

The most glorious part of God’s creation is man himself.  Man and woman are the greatest part of God’s creation. 

> “When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas.  O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!” (Psalm 8:3-9)

#### Attributes man is unique in God’s creation
- Man was created at the very end of the week of creation. 
- Man was created in God’s image.  
- Man was given the responsibility to rule over all the animals of the earth.
- Man’s creation is described in greater detail in Genesis 2.

#### Principles to remember about man’s uniqueness
- We need to be humble in light of God’s goodness to make us in his image.
- We should see human life as very dear and precious, never to be taken lightly.
- God values human life so much that in Genesis 9:6 he requires putting someone to death for the crime of murder.

### 4.2 Made in God’s Image

> “Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”  So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” (Genesis 1:26-28)

Both men and women are created completely in the image of God.  They are of equal value and importance to God.

#### We are made in God’s image through our inner qualities.

God is spirit and does not have a body.  The main way we are made in God’s image is through the inner qualities God has put within us.

We have minds and emotions. We have an ability to choose.  We have an inner character with the design to be holy, loving, forgiving, truthful, and faithful.

Sin did great damage to these qualities.  We are remade  into the image of God through what Christ has done for us.  

> “But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices 1and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.” (Colossians 3:8-10) 

#### We are made in God’s image through our responsibility.

We are called to do whatever God commands us.  We are to act as God wants us to act, and this is part of what it means to be made in God’s image.

### 4.3 Other Aspects of Our Human Nature

#### We are creatures, and God is the creator.

We must admit our complete dependence on God for everything in our life.  All creation is dependent on God.  Because we have the capacity to understand this truth, we can honor God and thank God each day.

God has complete rights over us, and as his creatures, we should render complete obedience and love to him. Anything less would be a crime against the great majesty of God and would be deserving of everlasting judgment.

#### God has given us the ability to know the difference between right and wrong.

Animals have emotions and some capacity to follow commands.  Man has a unique moral nature and conscience.

> “For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them.” (Romans 2:14-15)

Because of sin, our ability to tell right from wrong is obscured.  Wven though they often don’t work correctly, our moral natures give us the ability to know right from wrong and to act accordingly.  Therefore, God will judge our actions and motives of our hearts. 

#### Our bodies as well as our souls were created good. 

> “And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.” (Genesis 1:31)

Some believe that our soul is good, but our body is bad.  That is not true.  Our bodies and every part of us are damaged by sin.  Still the human body is one of the good gifts that God has given to us as human beings.

#### While man and woman are completely equal in value before God, woman is under man’s leadership and authority since she was created after him, to be of help to him.

> “So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” (Genesis 2:21-23)

> “I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet she will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.” (1 Timothy 2:12-15)

> “For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.” (1 Corinthians 11:6-10)

Men and women are equal in their common human natures, both being made in the image of God.  God gives men and women different roles in the home and in the church.  We are equal and yet different at the same time, and in this we reflect something of how the Persons of the Trinity relate.

### 4.4 How Sin Came into Our World and What Sin Is

#### Biblical account of man’s fall

> “Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ” But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.” (Genesis 3:1-7)

#### Truths about sin
- Sin works by deceiving us, causing us to doubt the truth and believe in falsehood.
- Sin causes us to turn from God and His ways in order to do what we think is best.
- Sin always results in harm, ruin and death.

### 4.5 How Sin Has Spread to All People

> “Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned - for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come. But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man’s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. And the free gift is not like the result of that one man’s sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. For if, because of one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ. Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. For as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.” (Romans 5:12-19)

When Adam sinned, all of us who come from Adam would receive sin in our own inner lives (our natures). We are born into this world with sinful natures that trace back to the sin of Adam.  Adam’s sinful nature results in our having sinful natures. And Adam’s guilt and condemnation carry over to our being guilty and deserving death. 

> “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” (Psalm 51:5)

**We sin in our own lives because we were already sinners in Adam.** We come from Adam into this world as newborn sinners, and later when we know better, we act out that sin.

> “For each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush.” (Luke 6:44)

A tree does not become an apple tree when it produces its first apple.  A tree bears apples because it already is an apple tree. 

**We are responsible along with Adam for Adam’s sin.** The Bible declares that since Adam was the first human at the head of the human race, what he did affected all of us who come after him. We may not like this, but this is how God sees it.  God always sees things correctly, exactly as they are.  

When we act sinfully, we act in ways that we desire and intend.  So God is right to hold us responsible for our sin. We need to accept the fact that as sinners by nature and as sinners by choice, we are deeply guilty before God. We cannot shift the blame. Before God, we are guilty for our sin, and we cannot pass off our guilt to anyone else.

### 4.6 The Punishment for Sin

> “And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”  (Genesis 2:16-17)

The death spoken of here means more than dying physically or having your body die.  Death for sin involves most importantly a separation from God and all that God is.  To be separated from God is to be separated from everything that is good.

> “They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.” (2 Thessalonians 1:9-10)

When everything that is good is removed from us, what we have left is painful and miserable and horrible beyond our imagination. The Bible states clearly that the punishment for our sin involves great misery that can never be ended.

> “And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.  And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.’ But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.” (Luke 16:23-26)

Jesus taught a lot about hell and eternal punishment.

> “And throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matthew 13:42)

> “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” (Matthew 25:41)

> “And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.” (Mark 9:43-48)

When we see how great the punishment for our sin is, we realize in new ways just how great our sin is before God.  And when we see the greatness of our punishment for sin, we also see better the greatness of Christ’s sacrifice to bear our punishment in our place.  

**Great punishment, great sin; great punishment, great Savior.**

## 5. Who Is Jesus?
### 5.1 A Person Who Was Alive Long Before He Was Born

Jesus is God and is pre-existent, alive before he was born to the virgin Mary.

> “Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.” So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?” Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.” (John 8:56-58)

> “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14)

> “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6)

### 5.2 The Incarnation - God and Man Together

The incarnation, the joining together of the eternal Son of God with a full human nature, is one of the greatest wonders of all history. God brought this about for our salvation since this is the only way that our loving and holy God would be able to save us from our sin. 

> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.” (John 1:1,14)

The Word has always been with God. This does not mean that the Word is not God himself.  Rather, the one God is more than one Person.  The Word has always been God. The Word is eternal and has no beginning. 

- As the Word who is the eternal Son of the Father, this Word has always existed with God his Father. 
- The Word is in nature the eternal God, and this Word has always existed as God. 
- The Word has come to earth and has become also fully a man. 

> “Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.” (Hebrews 1:1-3)

The Son is the greatest revelation of God, since now God is speaking to us through his own Son. The Son shows forth the radiance of God’s very glory, and the Son is the exact imprint of God’s own nature. God the Son with the full glory of God should unite with full man in order to make the glory of God known to other men.

### 5.3 How Jesus Emptied Himself in Becoming Also a Man

“Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in **Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.** And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”

Jesus, the Son who was fully God, rather than refusing to leave the glories of his place with the Father, poured himself or emptied himself out, taking the form of a servant.  Christ “poured himself out,” not that he poured out qualities from himself.

He poured himself out (all of who he was as God) by taking the form of a servant; he emptied himself (all of who he was as God) by taking on human nature.

Christ willingly gave up the rightful use of some of the abilities of his divine nature in order to experience fully his life now as a man. So, while he was in nature fully God, yet in order to live in nature fully as a man, he gave up the expression or exercise of some of his divine abilities. He did not give up those divine abilities themselves.

### 5.4 Jesus Lived in the Power of the Spirit

Isaiah speaks of a coming day when the long awaited Messiah would come to bring good news of restoration for the people of God. To do this, the Spirit of God would be upon the Messiah.

> “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; to grant to those who mourn in Zion — to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.” (Isaiah 61:1-3)

The ability and power for the Messiah to carry out this calling came from the Spirit who had come upon him.

> “And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” (Luke 4:17-21)

> “But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.” (Matthew 12:28)
 
Peter said that Jesus lived faithfully and performed miracles because God (his Father) had anointed him “with the Holy Spirit and with power,” that God was “with him” throughout his life.

> “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.” (Acts 10:38)

To live by his power as God, Jesus would not and could not live as one of us.  So instead, as a man, he relied on the Spirit of God to grant him all that he needed to live life faithfully and to carry out everything that the Father sent him to do. As a man, empowered by the Spirit, he fulfilled his calling.

### 5.5 Jesus Resisted Temptation, Living a Sinless Life

#### Jesus committed no sin

> “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

> “For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.” (Hebrews 4:15)

> “He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.” (1 Peter 2:22-23)

> “You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.” (1 John 3:5)

#### Why is it that Christ could not have sinned? 

Answer: because as God he could not sin. God cannot sin, and Christ could not do something that would stain his divine nature. 

#### Why is it that Christ did not sin? 

Answer: because as a man, empowered with the Spirit and filled with God’s word, he used everything that was given him by the Father to remain obedient.

### 5.6 What the Early Church Believed about Christ 

#### Modalism taught by Sabellius (False)

There is only one God, and the Father is that eternal God.  But the Father decided to come to earth in the “mode” of the Son, being born as Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  After the resurrection and ascension of Christ, then the Father decided to come to earth in the “mode” of the Holy Spirit. At Pentecost (Acts 2), the Father, now as the Spirit, came and dwelt in the lives of the early Christians.

God is first the Father, and then he is the Son, and then he is the Spirit, one at a time, rather than being Father, Son, and Spirit all at the same time, eternally.

#### Subordinationism taught by Arius (False)

The Son was the first created being and was great in power. But only the Father was uncreated and eternal. So even though the Son was great, as a creature he was “subordinate” or lesser in his nature than the Father.

#### Council of Nicea in A.D. 325

The Nicene Creed that was written and is still recited in many of our churches today followed **Athanasius**, insisting that Christ was “one nature” or the identically “same nature” (homoousios) with the Father.

#### Docetism taught by Apollinarius (False)

Apollinarius denied that Christ was also fully man. Apollinarius could not see how Christ could be both fully God and fully man, and so he began to teach that in Christ, the full divine nature had come to rest within a human body but was not joined to a full human nature. So Christ looked like a man from the outside, but on the inside he was fully, but only, God.

#### Council at Constantinople in A.D. 381

The council of Constantinople met and rejected the Apollinarian view, arguing that if Christ had not taken on our full human nature, he could not have offered himself as one of us and died in our place, for our sin. If Christ was not fully human, Christ could not be our Savior. So the full deity of Christ and the full humanity of Christ were defended in the first two councils of the church.

#### Nestorian Controversy View (False)

Nestorius could not understand how Christ could have the full nature of God and the full nature of man without also being two persons, one divine and one human.

#### Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431

Eusebius and Cyril of Alexandria proposed that the Person of the eternal Son came and joined himself to a human nature, but he did not join himself to a human person. If Jesus was two persons, he would not truly be an individual who lived, ministered, and died on the cross. Rather, Christ is one person with two natures, insisted the Council of Ephesus. Christ, then, is fully God (Nicea) and fully man (Constantinople), two natures in one person (Ephesus).

#### Eutychian View (False)

Eutyches had proposed that the divine and human natures in Jesus had co-mingled, so that a divine-human blend of natures had resulted. Jesus had both a divinized humanity and a humanized deity in his natures.

#### Council of Chalcedon in A.D. 451

The Council of Chalcedon rejected the Eutychian view, proposing instead that the two natures of Jesus be understood as joined together but with “no confusion, no change, no division, no separation.” Each nature was fully present without “confusion”, but also without separation, so that the human and divine natures would be together forever in the Person of Jesus Christ.

#### Conclusion of Four Councils

So all four councils contributed very importantly to the church’s understanding of Christ. Jesus Christ was fully God (Nicea) and fully man (Constantinople), with a divine nature and a human nature that are conjoined but not confused (Chalcedon) in one Person (Ephesus). 
## 6. Works of Jesus Christ
### 6.1 Jesus’ Death Shows God’s Justice and Mercy Toward Our Sin

Jesus did have to die.  There was no other way.

> “And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.” (Matthew 26:39)

#### Three ideas to explain why the cross of Christ was needed.

- We are sinners, we deserve eternal death, and we can’t do anything about it. (Romans 3:23; 5:12; 6:23; Galatians 2:16-17; Ephesians 2:1)
- God is just, we are sinners, and as a result God must and will bring judgment on our sin. (Galatians 6:7-8)
- God is full of grace and mercy, abounding in love to sinners who deserve eternal condemnation. 

> “But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8)

> “In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:10)

**The Problem of Mercy**:  How can a holy, just, and righteous God show mercy and kindness to sinners who deserve the judgment that he, as God, is obligated to execute?

God made a plan by which our sin and its full guilt would be charged against God’s own Son. The Son bore our sin and its guilt in himself.  The judgment that we deserved was directed at him, not at us. On the cross, Jesus bore our sin and paid the punishment for our guilt, and this did two things at once. 

- Jesus’ payment for our sin satisfied the full demands of God’s justice against our sin.
- Jesus’ payment for our sin provided everything God’s mercy and love sought to accomplish in bringing forgiveness to sinners.

> “Whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.” (Romans 3:25-26)

### 6.2 Jesus Paid the Full Penalty for Sin

#### Jesus died in our place, taking our sin upon himself, and paying the penalty we deserved to pay for our sin.

This is the cross as **penal substitution**. The word substitution refers to the fact that Christ took our place and died instead of us having to die. And the word penal refers to the fact that as Christ died as a substitute sacrifice in our place, he paid the penalty that we deserved to pay.  Penal substitution means that Christ paid the penalty of our sin (penal) as he died in our place on the cross (substitution).

> “Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.” (Isaiah 53:4-6)

> “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

> “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree” (Galatians 3:13)

#### Jesus satisfied the demands of God’s just judgment against our sin through his death on the cross.

The word often used here is **propitiation**, a word that refers to the Father’s just wrath being satisfied since Christ, by his death, paid the penalty for our sin fully.

> “Whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.” (Romans 3:25)

“When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin
Because the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me.”
(second verse of Before the Throne of God Above by Charitie L. Bancroft in 1863)

### 6.3 Jesus’ Victory over Satan by His Payment for Sin

Satan is the greatest villain, the worst enemy, the most powerful opponent who has ever existed or will ever exist.

> “In which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.” (Ephesians 2:2)

> “And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.  In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:3-4)

> “And they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.” (2 Timothy 2:26)

> “We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.” (1 John 5:19)

#### Christ has conquered Satan and all of the powers of darkness.

Christ, by his death and resurrection, won the victory over Satan who had the power of death. Christ’s victorious work brings this same victory over Satan to Christ’s followers.

> “Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.” (Hebrews 2:14-15)

> “Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.” (1 John 3:8)

The victory of Christ over Satan happens only as Christ pays the penalty of our sin.  The way that Christ “disarmed” Satan and the forces of darkness was through his removal of our sin and its debt.  Satan’s power over sinners is tied directly to their guilt through sin. His hold on them is because of their sinful rebellion against God. But remove the guilt through Christ’s payment for their sin, and you remove the basis for Satan’s hold on them.

> “And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.” (Colossians 2:13-15)

The legal requirement that we had before our holy God to pay off our debt is removed since that debt was paid fully in Christ. This is sometimes called **expiation**.  The liability we owed before a holy God to pay the penalty for breaking his Law is now removed and forgiven.  Forgiveness of sin’s penalty and freedom from Satan’s prison go together.

> “He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.” (Colossians 1:13-14)

### 6.4 Jesus’ Resurrection: the Proof that Christ’s Death for Sin Worked

The resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead is the basis of hope for Christians. 

> “This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.” (Acts 2:32)

> “But God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.” (Acts 10:40-41)

> “Because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.” (Acts 17:31)

> “For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.” (1 Corinthians 15:3-5)

> “For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.” (1 Corinthians 15:16-19)

Sin comes to us as a **penalty** we cannot pay and as a **power** we cannot overcome.

- Sin’s penalty is death. (Romans 6:23)
- Sin’s power is death. (1 Corinthians 15:53-56)

Christ, by his death on the cross, has fully paid sin’s penalty.  The only way it could be shown that Christ’s payment for sin has truly worked is for Christ to be raised from the dead.  The resurrection of Christ is necessary to prove that his payment for sin was full and final.

The only way it could be shown that Christ’s victory over sin’s power has truly worked is for Christ to be raised from the dead.  If Christ really conquered sin’s power completely, since sin’s greatest power is death, then the only way this could be shown is for Christ to be raised alive from the dead. The resurrection of Christ is necessary to prove and show that his victory over sin’s power was full and final.

### 6.5 Jesus is King over All

God has appointed Jesus to be the King who will reign over all of creation forever and ever.

> “He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.” (2 Samuel 7:13)

> “As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill.” I will tell of the decree: The Lord said to me, “You are my Son; today I have begotten you. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” (Psalm 2:6-9)

> “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.” (Isaiah 9:6-7)

> “My servant David shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall walk in my rules and be careful to obey my statutes. They shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They and their children and their children’s children shall dwell there forever, and David my servant shall be their prince forever. I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them in their land and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore. My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.” (Ezekiel 37:24-28)

In Jesus’ first coming, he came as the Suffering Servant to take away the sin of the world. Some of the promises connected with the Messiah were fulfilled. Many were left unfulfilled.

In Jesus’ second coming, he will fulfill all the rest of what has been prophesied, from judgment on the nations (Revelation 19:11–21) to righteousness on the earth and the restoration of the people of God (Revelation 20–22).

### 6.6 Is Jesus Really the Only Savior?

Jesus alone qualifies, in his person and work, as the only one capable of actually bringing about forgiveness of sin for anyone in all of the world.  Of all the people who have lived and ever will live, there will be no one qualified to complete the work of salvation except Jesus alone.

**Jesus alone qualifies as Savior, and Jesus alone is Savior.**

> “Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6)

> “And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12)

#### 1. Jesus alone was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin. (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 1:26-38)

In order for Jesus to be a Savior, to bring about forgiveness of sin, he must be both God and man. But in order for Jesus to be both fully God and fully man, he must be conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of a human virgin.

#### 2. Jesus alone is God incarnate. (John 1:1-18; Philippians 2:5-11; 1 Timothy 2:5-6; Hebrews 1:1-3; 2:14-18)

Our Savior must be fully man in order to substitute himself for men and die in their place.  He must be fully God in order for the value of his life’s payment to satisfy the demands of our infinitely holy God.

#### 3. Jesus alone lived a sinless life. (2 Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 4:15; 7:23-28; 9:13-14; 1 Peter 2:21-24)

The sacrifice of Christ who, sinless, was able to die for the sins of others because he did not have to die for any sin of his own.

#### 4. Jesus alone died a substitutionary death as payment for the sins of others. (Isaiah 53:4-6; Romans 3:21-26; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Galatians 3:10-14)

Jesus lived a sinless life; so he did not deserve to die. The cause of his death was entirely because the Father placed our sin upon him as he hung on the cross (2 Corinthians 5:21). The death that he died was in our place paying the full penalty for our sin.

#### 5. Jesus alone rose from the dead triumphant over sin. (Acts 2:22-24; Romans 4:25; 1 Corinthians 15:3-8, 16-23)

A few people other than Christ have been raised from the dead (1 Kings 17:17–24; John 11:38–44), but only Christ has been raised from the dead never to die again, having defeated all sin. Christ’s resurrection from the dead shows that his atoning death for sin brought about both the full payment of sin’s penalty and full victory over sin’s greatest power.
## 7. Holy Spirit
### 7.1 The Works of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament

The Holy Spirit came upon just a few people:  Moses, the seventy, Bezalel, some prophets, Saul, David, etc. The Spirit’s coming was (1) selective, (2) task-oriented, and (3) of limited duration, tied to the duration of the task.  

#### Holy Spirit comes upon prophets

> “And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by tribe. And the Spirit of God came upon him.” (Numbers 24:2)

> “Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him opposite them, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.” (2 Kings 2:15)

#### Holy Spirit comes upon leaders of Israel

> “Then the Lord said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you. And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone.” (Numbers 11:16-17)

> “So the Lord said to Moses, “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him.” (Numbers 27:18)

> “And the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled.” (1 Samuel 11:6)

> “Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.” (1 Samuel 16:13)

#### Holy Spirit comes upon judges

> “The Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.” (Judges 3:10)

> “But the Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him.” (Judges 6:34)

> “Then the Spirit of the Lord was upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites.” (Judges 11:29)

> “Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.” (Judges 14:6)

#### Holy Spirit comes upon craftsman building Tabernacle and Temple

> “And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability and intelligence, with knowledge and all craftsmanship” (Exodus 31:3)

> “And he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship.” (Exodus 35:31)

### 7.2 Old Testament Promises of Future Spirit Transformation

The Spirit’s work in Old Testament times tended to be upon a select number of people, primarily to empower them to carry out specific callings or tasks, and when the task or calling ended, most likely the Spirit-empowerment also ended. When we look at Old Testament teaching about the future coming of the Spirit in an age to come, all three of these features are overturned. 

- The Spirit’s coming will no longer be on a select few of God’s people but on all. 
- The Spirit’s coming will not merely empower tasks to be done or callings to be carried out, but now the Spirit will transform God’s people to become holy and obedient. 
- The Spirit’s coming will not be limited in duration but be forever.

> “Until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is deemed a forest. Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness abide in the fruitful field. And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever. My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.” (Isaiah 32:15-18)_

> “But now hear, O Jacob my servant, Israel whom I have chosen! Thus says the Lord who made you, who formed you from the womb and will help you: Fear not, O Jacob my servant, Jeshurun whom I have chosen. For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants. They shall spring up among the grass like willows by flowing streams. This one will say, ‘I am the Lord’s,’ another will call on the name of Jacob, and another will write on his hand, ‘The Lord’s,’ and name himself by the name of Israel.” (Isaiah 44:1-5)

> “Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Lord God, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules. You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.” (Ezekiel 36:22-28)

> “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. Even on the male and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit.” (Joel 2:28-29)

### 7.3 The Spirit on Jesus and His Followers

The New Testament begins with the Spirit being poured out on Jesus. As his ministry began, at his first opportunity, Jesus read the opening verses of Isaiah 61.

Jesus could have read from Isaiah 53 to announce that he was the Suffering Servant, but instead he chose Isaiah 61. Being seen as the Spirit-anointed Messiah was so important to a correct understanding of who Jesus is that he chose Isaiah 61 as his opening passage.

> “And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.” (Luke 4:18-19)

> “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.” (Acts 10:38)

Jesus told His disciples it was good news that he was leaving.  What is better than having Jesus living with you and walking alongside you day by day?  The answer is having Jesus, by his Spirit, living his own life within you. 

> “And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you. ” (John 14:16-17)

> “Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.” (John 16:7)

Forty days after Jesus had died and been raised, on the Day of Pentecost, Jesus poured out the Spirit upon all those who believed in him. The day of the pouring out of the Spirit on all of Jesus’ followers finally happened.  These Spirit-filled believers began telling other people about God’s wonderful saving work in Jesus, and they were able to say all of this in languages they had never learned.

> “Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.” (Acts 2:33)

The Holy Spirit gives us power to tell others about Jesus’ death and resurrection for their sin. The Spirit gives us power to share the good news of the gospel with those who need to hear it.

### 7.4 Holy Spirit Gives New Life in Christ

When we are born into this world as babies, we are alive physically, but we are actually born spiritually dead.

> “And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.” (Ephesians 2:1-2)

We must be born again. We must be born not only physically but also spiritually. Only if we are born of the Spirit can we be alive spiritually. There is nothing we can do to make ourselves become spiritually alive. The Spirit must cause us to be born again. 

> “Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”  (John 3:5-8)

If the Spirit must work for us to be born again, the only thing we can do is bow our heads and admit before God that we are helpless to save ourselves. We need to put our hope in the kindness of God, his mercy toward sinners, and his power to save those who admit they cannot save themselves.

> “He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.” (Titus 3:5)

### 7.5 Holy Spirit Unites Believers Together in Christ

The Bible uses both **family** and **body** as illustrations of how the Holy Spirit unites believers together in Christ.

#### A New Family

The Holy Spirit brings believers together with all other believers so that they become a “family” of new brothers and sisters in Christ.

> “See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.” (1 John 3:1-2)

If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, you are a child of God.  The Holy Spirit plays a very important role in this adoption process.

> “For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.” (Romans 8:14-17)

> “But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” (Galatians 4:4-6)

#### A New Body

The Holy Spirit works to unite believers together in Christ is by putting them together into one new “body” in Christ.

> “For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and all were made to drink of one Spirit.” (1 Corinthians 12:13)

> We need each other, and so the Spirit puts us together, even giving each of us special gifts so we can help each other grow in our relationship with Christ (1 Corinthians 12:4–26).

Those who come together in Christ are often very different from each other.  Because believers are united as brothers and sisters in Christ, they are to accept and love all believers, even if they are from a different culture or their skin is a different color or they speak a different language.

### 7.6 Holy Spirit Fills Believers to Live for Christ

After giving people new life and uniting them together and with Christ, the Holy Spirit continues his work in each believer’s life. The Bible speaks about this part of the ongoing work of the Spirit as the filling of the Spirit.

> “And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.” (Ephesians 5:18-21)

Instead of drinking too much wine that ends up influencing you to speak and act in ways that are sinful, let the Spirit be such a strong influence in your life that you end up speaking and acting in ways that are holy and honoring to Christ.

Since the Holy Spirit is the One who has used his great power to give sinners new life in Christ, so the Spirit is the One who also gives believers that same power to live lives that are pleasing to Christ.

> “But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit.” (Galatians 5:16-25)

The Spirit will have a greater influence and will provide more direction in our lives as God’s Word dwells more and more within us. Our reading of his Word and our time spent memorizing and meditating on Scripture is one tools that the Spirit uses to help us think and act in ways that are pleasing to Christ.

> “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.” (Colossians 3:16-17)

## 8. Our Salvation
### 8.1 God’s Kindness and Wisdom in Choosing Some to Save

If God were to leave it up to us, not a single person would ever want to be with God, and no one would ever desire to do what pleases God.

> “As it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.” (Romans 3:10-12)

God, in his mercy and undeserved kindness, has decided that he will not leave all of us in our sin to face his judgment. Instead God has decided to choose some sinners to be the objects of his most precious love, to receive kindness and grace that they do not deserve, to have their sins forgiven by the death of his Son, and to enter into fellowship with him now and forever.

> “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved.” (Ephesians 1:3-6)

### 8.2 What Must I Do to Be Saved?

Sinners are saved when they “believe” in Christ or “trust” in Christ or put their “faith” in Christ. Belief, trust, and faith in Christ are different ways to talk about the same idea in the Bible. 

To believe in Christ (or trust in Christ or put faith in Christ) means to rely completely on what Christ has done in his death and resurrection for my sin.  My hope of being right in God’s sight is all because of Christ and has nothing to do with any good thing I might ever say or do.

> “For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)

> “Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.” (Romans 4:4-5)

While faith is the opposite of “works” (Ephesians 2:8–9), faith is also the opposite of “not obeying.” 

> “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.” (John 3:36)

The Bible speaks about turning from our sin (repentance) and believing in Christ. Repentance involves seeing sin for the deceitful and deadly thing that it is, so that we turn from it.  Belief in Christ involves seeing Christ for the gracious and powerful Savior that he is, so that we turn to him. These two acts go together in a person’s salvation.

> “And saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.” (Mark 1:15)

> “Testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 20:21)

### 8.3 Declared Right in God’s Eyes When We Believe

At the moment that sinners trust Christ alone for the forgiveness of all of their sins and the only hope they have of receiving eternal life, God credits them with the righteousness of His own Son. 

> “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

The plan of salvation involves three acts of imputation.
- God imputes Adam’s sin on us.
- God imputes (charges) believer’s sins to Christ.
- God imputes (credits) Christ’s righteousness to believers.

Some have referred to this as “the great exchange.” God imputes our sin to Christ, and in exchange God imputes Christ’s righteousness to those who believe. 

When God imputes (credits) the righteousness of Christ to those who believe, those believers are seen by God as righteous. Believers continue to have sinful inner lives.  They continue to struggle with not always thinking the right thoughts, having the right attitudes, saying the right words, or doing the right things.  God declares as righteous those who are still very unrighteous only because they have been given the righteousness of another, the perfect righteousness of Christ.

> “Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.” (Romans 4:4-5)

### 8.4 Made More Like Christ through All of Our Lives

Sin is both a penalty that we cannot pay, and sin is a power that we cannot overcome. The Bible talks about two ways that God works in believers’ lives that deal with the two ways that sin has hurt them. Through the work of Christ on the cross, God has planned a way to take care of the penalty of sin we deserve to pay and a way to take care of the power of sin that holds us as its prisoners.

God’s way to deal with the penalty of sin that we cannot pay is God’s plan of **justification**. God’s way to deal with the power of sin that we cannot overcome is God’s plan of **sanctification**. The term sanctification means to be set apart or separate, to be different, to be holy. 

In sanctification, God goes to work in our lives to overpower sin’s power, to bring to an end sin’s control, to free us from sin’s slavery.

At the very moment that a sinner puts faith in Christ to be saved, God separates that person from the control of Satan and frees that person from slavery to sin. God does this as he places that person instead in Christ. We might call this way in which we are separated from Satan and unto Christ our **positional sanctification**.

> “He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.  (Colossians 1:13-14)

> “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.” (2 Corinthians 5:17-18)

A second way we should think of God’s work to remove sin from our lives, making us more like Christ, might be called **progressive sanctification**. This involves God’s daily work in us, helping us to turn from sin and become more like Christ day by day. 

- The Bible can work powerfully to change how we think, how we feel, and how we live. Giving much attention to reading the Bible and hearing it faithfully preached can bring about great growth in our lives. 
- Prayer is a very important tool that God uses to help us understand how much we need God, how dependent we are on God. 
- Fellowship of other believers can give us comfort, encouragement, correction, and instruction to see better how Christ would have us live.

### 8.5 Not Saved by Good Works But Saved For Good Works

While good works have nothing to do with why we have been saved, good works truly show that we have been saved.

> “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” (Ephesians 2:10)

> “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.” (Titus 2:11-14)

If we say that we have trusted Christ, but we have no desire to obey Christ or please Christ or do the good works God wants us to do, then it may be that we have not truly trusted Christ. We are saved for good works, and those good works will begin to show more and more in the lives of Christ’s real followers. 

Every person who truly puts faith in Christ alone for salvation and is justified will be made fully like Christ and glorified. (John 10:27-29; Romans 8:31-39; 1 Corinthians 1:8-9; Ephesians 1:13-14; Philippians 1:6; 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24; 1 Peter 1:3-5)

### 8.6 People Must Know and Believe in Christ to Be Saved

#### Jesus’ teaching shows that the nations need to hear and repent to be saved.

> “Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things. And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.” (Luke 24:44-49)

- What is the present condition of people, as Jesus describes them here? Answer: unforgiven and unrepentant sinners. And since they are still in their sin, they are not saved.
- What must happen for them to be forgiven (saved)? Answer: they must repent of their sin.
- What is needed for them to repent of their sin so they can be forgiven and saved? Answer: a proclamation is needed that calls them to repent.
- What is the content of the proclamation? Answer: they are to hear a proclamation “in his name”; so the content must be about Jesus who suffered and rose on the third day.
- Who are these unrepentant and unforgiven sinners who need to repent to be saved but who can only repent as they hear a proclamation of Christ and the gospel? Answer: “all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.” All people in all the nations, even those in Jerusalem who have the Law of Moses and the whole Old Testament, need to hear about Christ in order to repent, to be forgiven, to be saved.

#### [[Paul]] teaches that even devout Jews, and everyone else, must hear and believe in Christ to be saved.

> “Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.” (Romans 10:1-4)

> “For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!” (Romans 10:13-15)

#### Cornelius’s story demonstrates that even devout Gentiles must hear and believe in Christ to be saved.

> “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”  (Acts 10:38-43)

> “He will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.” (Acts 11:14)

**Jesus is the only Savior, and people must know and believe in Christ to be saved.**

## 9. Church of Jesus Christ
### 9.1 Jesus Is the Lord of the Church

All real churches, and the whole church from the beginning, belong to one Person, the Lord Jesus Christ. He alone is the Lord of the church.  The church belongs to Jesus.

> “And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” (Matthew 16:18)

In John 10, the church is said to be like **sheep** that need to be fed and watered, sheep that also need protection from dangerous wolves.  The shepherd leads, and the sheep follow. The shepherd provides food and water, and the sheep eat and drink as the shepherd directs.

Another way the church is pictured is as a **bride**, with Christ as the bridegroom.  

> “For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.” (2 Corinthians 11:2-3)

The word church literally means “called out ones.” We are people called out of the sin and rebellion of the world to be devoted completely to Christ.

> “Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.” (Ephesians 5:24)

Revelation describes the joyous day when the church will be clothed in white for her marriage to Christ.

> “Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready; it was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure” — for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints. And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.” (Revelation 19:7-9)

The church is spoken of in the Bible as the **body** of Christ.  (1 Corinthians 12:12-26)  Christ is the head of the church.  He directs the church forward, to grow and to become what he wants it to be.

> “And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.” (Ephesians 1:22-23)

The church where you worship may in one sense be your church, but more accurately, it is Christ’s church.

### 9.2 People of the New Covenant

In the Bible, there are agreements that take place between God and his people. These agreements are often called covenants. They say what God’s people are responsible to do before God, and they also state what God promises he will do.

These covenants are drawn up by God without asking for his people’s ideas about how they think things should be.  God decides. He is God. And whatever God has decided, his people must do. This is how God’s covenants with his people work.

The Law of Moses or the Mosaic Covenant, gave very clear and detailed instructions for the people’s lives. God made it clear that if they obeyed this Law, they would receive great blessing from God. But if they disobeyed the Law, God would bring horrible punishment upon them. (Leviticus 26; Deuteronomy 28–30) But throughout the history of the people of Israel, sadly they often turned away from the Law and disobeyed what God had told them.

God knew that Israel would disobey.  He planned all along to replace this Old Covenant, the Mosaic Covenant, with a new covenant.

> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” (Jeremiah 31:31-34)

The Old Covenant, the Law of Moses, was intended by God to show his people the sin of their own hearts. God knew that they could not keep the Law since their own sin would urge them to break the Law.

> “What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.” But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead.” (Romans 7:7-8)

> “Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary. Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one. Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.” (Galatians 3:19-25)

The church is not under the Law of Moses and the Old Covenant. The church is under the New Covenant in which God writes his laws and commands on our hearts.  His Spirit works within believers’ hearts to remake their inner lives so that they learn to love the things of God. Over time the Spirit gives God’s people new tastes, new longings, new desires, so that what they want to do is what God wants them to do. The New Covenant is kept because the Spirit works within believers’ lives to make them grow more in wanting to follow God’s ways.

> “For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” (Romans 8:3-4)

By the Spirit, not by our own efforts, we grow to become more like Christ and live more pleasing to the Lord.

### 9.3 Communities of Christians Who Worship and Serve Together

The word church is a translation of the Greek word _ekklesia_.  The work ek means “out”, and kaleo means “to call.”  The word church refers to those who are “called out” by God to join together as his people,

Sometimes church is used of all of the followers of Jesus from the very first disciples down to today. The term **universal church** is used for this wider meaning referring to all true Christians from the time of Christ to today, from all places in the world. (1 Corinthians 10:32; 12:28; Ephesians 3:10; Colossians 1:24)

Church is more often used in a narrower way, referring to specific gatherings or communities of Christians who meet together regularly for worship and for service. The term **local church** is used for these individual gatherings of Christians in specific places. (1 Corinthians 1:2; Galatians 1:2; 1 Thessalonians 1:1; Colossians 4:5)

We should understand that there are many more followers of Christ than those who meet in any of our own local churches.  Whether you go to a large or small church, still there are millions more Christians who have been true and faithful followers of Jesus throughout history and across the world.  We are part of this larger church even though we don’t know most of those people.

Christians cannot sing songs of praise and gather to worship God in the universal church.  Christians must meet in smaller local gatherings to sing, pray, worship, hear preaching, be baptized, take the Lord’s Supper, serve one another, hold each other accountable, and urge one another to love and do good deeds.

> “And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.” (Hebrews 10:24-25)

Christians gather together to **worship** God in communities of faith. Christians grow as they participate in singing hymns and songs of praise, as they pray for one another and for needs in many places, as they listen to the reading of God’s Word week by week, and as they hear the Scriptures faithfully taught and preached.

Christians gather together to **serve** God especially as they serve one another in local communities of Christian people. God has gifted you and me as believers so that we will use our gifts in serving other people.

### 9.4 Baptism: Picturing Jesus’ Death and Resurrection

Jesus gave his followers two practices that show what it means to believe in the Son of God who died and rose again to save them from their sin.  Both of these practices were commanded by Christ for his people to carry out; so they are often referred to as ordinances of the church.

Baptism is the ordinance Christ gave to be carried out when a person first puts his or her trust in Christ for salvation, at the beginning of new life in Christ.

> “And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:18-20)

The term baptize means “to dip under water,” “to submerge,” or “to immerse.”  Baptism is a beautiful picture of what it means for a believer in Jesus Christ to be joined together with Christ in his death for sin and in his resurrection to newness of life.

One who has trusted Christ for his salvation is dipped completely under water, only a moment later to be brought back up again. His being dipped under the water (often called immersion) is meant to picture that this believer is now so closely connected to Jesus Christ by faith that Christ’s own death has become this believer’s death. As he goes under the water, then, the Christian sees his own sin being paid for and his own death taking place as he is joined to Christ who died and paid for his sin in his place. An instant after this believer’s immersion into the water, he is brought up out of the water, showing that he is joined as well to Jesus’ resurrection life.

> “Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin.” (Romans 6:3-7)

**Believers’ baptism does not save believers, but it provides a vivid, living picture of what happened when they were saved.** Baptism gives an outward picture of what is true of their own inner life.

### 9.5 Lord’s Supper: Remembering Jesus’ Death and Resurrection

God instructed Israel to eat a particular meal just before he sent the angel to strike the homes of the Egyptians, killing the firstborn in every Egyptian home and stable. This was called the Passover meal because when the angel of death came to the camp of Israel in the land of Egypt, he saw the blood on the doorposts of their houses and “passed over” their homes, sparing them from death (Exodus 12:1–20; 13:3).  Israel was to celebrate the Passover meal each year, so that they would “remember the day” when God brought them out of the land of Egypt (Deuteronomy 16:3).

The second ordinances that Christ put in place for his church to practice is one in which they would regularly remember his death for their sin.  At his last supper with the disciples, Jesus used some of the items of their meal as symbols for his own upcoming death.

> “For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.” (1 Corinthians 11:23-26)

- The disciples of Jesus are to carry out Jesus’ instructions when they come together in a group, as a community of believers.
- The main focus is on the suffering and death of Christ. The broken bread is meant to picture Christ’s body broken as he hung on the cross. The wine or juice pictures Christ’s blood shed for sinners. 
- Jesus refers to the cup as “the new covenant in my blood.” Jesus brings about forgiveness of sin by his death on the cross. Only because of this may we be sure that the promise of the New Covenant will come true.
- While the New Covenant says that God will remember our sins no more, in the Lord’s Supper we are to remember Christ’s death for us. Part of what this means is recalling the story of Jesus’ suffering that all four Gospels tell us. As we recall God’s great act of salvation in his Son, we honor and worship God, and we thank him with all our heart for his mercy. Our purpose now is to follow him, love him, and obey him. This is also part of what it means to remember Christ’s death and resurrection for our sin.

### 9.6 Growing the Church through Making Disciples

> “And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.  Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, \teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”  (Matthew 28:18-20)

The command Christ gives is to “make disciples of all nations.”  Our job is to lead people from anywhere in the world to see Jesus as the great teacher whom they should want to listen carefully to, learn from, and model their lives after.

We are not being called here to seek to make disciples of ourselves. The idea is not that we want others to look to us, admire us, learn from us, and live like us. Jesus commands us is make disciples of himself. We only obey Christ when we direct people’s attention to the teaching of Christ, the wisdom of Christ, the grace and compassion and truth of Christ.

Three words are used in these verses to describe how making disciples of Jesus will take place.

#### Going

Jesus assumed that they understood that they must go. He knew that the Spirit who was coming would give them power to speak of Christ wherever they went. They have to go to where the people are throughout the world if disciples are to be made from all the nations. Although the command in this verse relates to making disciples, going is a very important and needed part.

> “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” (Acts 1:8)

#### Baptizing 

When Jesus says to make disciples by baptizing them into the name of the Christian God, he means to declare to them the gospel of Christ so they can believe in Christ and be saved. Their baptism is only real and it is only truly a sign of their union with Christ if they have in fact trusted Christ alone for the forgiveness of their sins and their only hope for eternal life.

#### Teaching

This command of Christ involves teaching those who have put their faith in Christ as much as it involves leading them to their initial faith in Christ. A disciple wants to learn everything he can from his teacher, to master the truth he knows and to live out the wisdom of his life. 

If baptizing had more to do with quantitative growth and seeing that more people are saved, “teaching them to observe” has more to do with qualitative growth. 

## 10. Second Coming of Jesus Christ
### 10.1 Knowing the Future Helps in the Present

God has told us the end of the story. He hasn’t told us everything about what is coming, and some things he has told us are not given in exact detail. He has told us enough so that if we are trusting in Christ, we can put away our fears and worries.
- We know what happens when we die.
- We know that Christ is coming again.
- We know that the kingdom of God will be established upon the whole world.
- We know that all evil will be judged.
- We know that those who have trusted in Jesus Christ for their salvation will live forever with Christ.

OT prophets speak about things that took place at the first coming of Christ right along with some other things that won’t take place until the second coming of Christ. (examples: Isaiah 11 and Isaiah 61)

### 10.2 What Happens to Us When We Die?

Life follows physical death. Death is not an ending of our existence as human beings. Rather, it is a point of transition to our lives for the rest of eternity.

> “And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment.” (Hebrews 9:27)

Physical death involves the separation of who we are on the inside from the bodies that make up part of our lives.  Death separates the material part of our lives from the immaterial. Our inner lives (immaterial) separate from our bodies (material) at death, but we continue living in our inner lives.

Believers enter into real joy and blessing at his physical death, even though he still awaits the resurrection of the body when the fullness of his transformed life will come.  Unbelievers may expect to enter into real misery and torment at his physical death, even though he also awaits the resurrection of his body and his final judgment before a holy God.

> “There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man’s table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.’ But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’ And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father’s house— for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’ And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’ ” (Luke 16:19-31)

> “Then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment.” (2 Peter 2:9)

> “So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, for we walk by faith, not by sight. Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.” (2 Corinthians 5:6-9)

> “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith.” (Philippians 1:21-25)

That we all will die is certain. That we will live after we die is also certain. Where we will live depends, though, on where we place our hope.

### 10.3 The Promise - Keeping God and the Salvation of Israel

Through the Old Testament, God made some amazing promises to the people of Israel that have not yet come to pass, at least not completely.

> “Now the Lord said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” (Genesis 12:1-3)

God will make of Abraham a great nation. God will make his name great. And God will bless the nations of the world through Abraham. God’s covenant with Abraham is **unconditional**. 

God made very clear that if Israel obeyed His law (Law of Moses), he would bless them greatly (see Leviticus 26:3–13; Deuteronomy 28:1–14). If they disobeyed his Law, he would punish them (see Leviticus 26:14–43; Deuteronomy 28:15–68). God’s covenant with Israel through Moses was **conditional**.

God will be true to both of these covenants. God punished Israel when they broke his Law.  God even raised up other nations (Assyria and Babylon) to destroy Israel and Judah.

God never forgot about his earlier promise that he would bless Israel unconditionally, that Israel would be his people and that he would be their God. The solution God planned was to make another covenant with Israel, a new covenant that would be unconditional like God’s covenant with Abraham.

> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. (Jeremiah 31:31-33)

> “And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.” (Ezekiel 36:27)

> “Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, “The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.” (Romans 11:25-26)

### 10.4 Jesus Will Come Again

Even though Jesus has gone now to be with his Father, he promised that he would return.

> “Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.  In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.” (John 14:1-3)

> “And said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”  (Acts 1:11)

When Jesus comes again, his purpose will no longer be to save sinners. Rather, he will show God’s anger at the sin of our world. He will bring God’s judgment against all of those who continue to rebel against God. 

> “The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. “Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. (John 5:22-27)

> “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.” (Matthew 25:31-32)

> “Since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.” (2 Thessalonians 1:6-10)

> “Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.” For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.” (Revelation 19:10-16)

Jesus will come again! That day will be one of great joy for Christ’s followers, for they will be raised and brought into Christ’s kingdom to live in God’s presence forever. But for those who continue in their sin, not trusting in Christ for their salvation, this day will be one of great sadness.  

### 10.5 Suffering of Hell and the Joy of Heaven

One of the most serious teachings of the Bible is that all people will live forever either in a place of great suffering or a place of great joy.

Jesus taught strongly about the reality and the horror of hell. Hell is a place where people who did evil and refused to trust in him will be sent in the end. The day will come when all those outside of Christ will stand before him in judgment and will receive the punishment they deserve. Some will be punished more strongly than others, but all will feel the pain and suffering of hell forever.

> “He also will drink the wine of God’s wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.” (Revelation 14:10-11)

> “Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.” (Revelation 20:11-15)

The Bible speaks about the final home for believers as a place of never-ending joy and happiness, a place always in the presence of God and his beauty, and a place of great satisfaction and fulfillment.

> “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”  (Revelation 21:1-4)

> “Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.” (Revelation 22:1-5)

- Heaven is on earth, the new earth that God will make. Believers are in their resurrected bodies (1 Corinthians 15:35–58), and they are made fully like Christ (1 John 3:2). 
- Believers will reign with Christ forever.
- Revelation 22 pictures us as back in the Garden of Eden with its tree of life. But the picture here shows a Garden of Eden better than before
- Heaven is a place of endless joy, happiness, freedom, fulfillment, beauty, and love.

### 10.6 God’s Greatness and Glory Shown Forever and Ever

In making all things new, God will grant all people everywhere a true and deep knowledge of him that will lead them to give him the glory, honor, thanksgiving, and praise that he alone deserves as God.

> “They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.” (Isaiah 11:9)

> “I am the Lord; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols. Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I now declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them.” Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that fills it, the coastlands and their inhabitants. Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the habitants of Sela sing for joy, let them shout from the top of the mountains. Let them give glory to the Lord, and declare his praise in the coastlands.” (Isaiah 42:8-12)

The greatest thing about the new creation is the glory of God because God himself possesses everything that is worthy of being honored, thanked, praised, adored, and worshipped. God has made us so that we long to be like what we adore. We want to become like what we love. We wish to take on the qualities of what it is we consider beautiful and good.

To glorify God is to enter into the joy of being like God in our character. Here is true happiness. Here is true fulfillment. Here is how the glory of God and the good of his people unite forever and ever.
