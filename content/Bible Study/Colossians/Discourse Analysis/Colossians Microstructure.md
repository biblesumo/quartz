## Col 1:3–2:3 - Live Worthily Having Been Reconciled by God's Preeminent Son

### Col 1:3–8 - Paul's Thanksgiving
- The first unit is a typical thanksgiving from [[Paul]] for his recipients (1:3–8). It is marked as a unit both by the fact that it constitutes one sentence (though note the semi-colon at the end of v.6 in NA28) and by the διὰ τοῦτο that begins a new unit in 1:9.
- This pattern of thanksgiving/blessing transitioned to prayer διὰ τοῦτο is paralleled in Ephesians 1:3–14, 15–23 (cf. Phil 1:3–8, 9–11 transitioned by καὶ τοῦτο).
- [[Paul]] gives thanks to God whenever he prays for the Colossians, because he has heard through [[Epaphras]] of their faith in Christ and their love toward all the saints, which they have because of the hope laid up for them in heaven. They heard about this hope in the gospel message, which [[Epaphras]] preached to them initially, and which is also "bearing fruit and growing" in all the world" (1:6). 
- Although [[Paul]] writes about hope as a causal basis for their love (διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα), it is fair to see the trio of faith, hope, and love as semantically grounding his thanksgiving. The mention of "the gospel" leads to increasing subordination of clauses, so that the core thoughts of this unit are at the beginning.

### Col 1:9-12 - Paul's Intercession
- Structure of 1:9–12 is without too many levels of subordination. 
- Begins in v.9 with διὰ τοῦτο, which transitions from the thanksgiving to [[Paul]]'s intercession for the Colossians.
	- Because of "this," (faith, love, and hope), that he says he never ceases praying for them.
- The content of his prayer is that they would be filled with the knowledge of God's will.
	- This core of the prayer is then modified by six clauses.
	- The means (ἐν) of being filled is "all wisdom and spiritual insight." 
	- The purpose of being filled is "to walk worthily of the Lord to fully please him."
- Four participial clauses that modify either () or ()
	- If the former, then they express the result of being filled and be the most prominent idea of the unit.
	- If the latter, they express the means by which they walk worthily, in which case the () purpose clause is the most prominent.
	- Latter is preferable
		- The first two participles are coherent as results of being filled with the knowledge of God's will. The third and fourth participles are less obviously so.
		- It is strange to have the infinitive () intervening between () and four participial phrases modifying it.
		- All four participles function coherently as a means of walking worthily.
	- Therefore, [[Paul]]'s ultimate purpose in praying for the Colossians is that they would walk worthily to fully please the Lord.
- This prayer is made "because of" (διὰ τοῦτο, 1:9) the faith, hope, and love [[Paul]] heard about from [[Epaphras]]. Because he heard they represent Christ in "all the world," he wants them to walk in a manner fully pleasing to the Lord and represent Him well. 
	- Succumbing to false philosophy would not represent him well, nor would it please the Lord.
- They can walk worthily by continuing to bear fruit and grow in the knowledge of God, by being strengthened with God's power, and by giving thanks to the Father (1:10–12).
- That the intercession builds directly on the thanksgiving is further evident from the linguistic correspondence between the two units.

### Col 1:13–20 - The Supremacy of Christ
- It is difficult to decide what to do with vv. 13–14. 
	- Grammatically, if we take the relative pronouns to indicate the continuation of a sentence, then vv.13–16 (through ) are all part of a long complex sentence beginning with διὰ τοῦτο in v.9. If we read a single sentence from v.9–16, then it would be its own unit.
	- Two reasons against this:
		- Relative pronouns offer elaboration on a concept already activated in the discourse, so semantically they may signal the beginning of a new elaborative unit.
		- While the grammatical "sentence" of vv. 9–16 could be viewed as a unit, this would clearly create an awekward (and surely wrong) division of the text in the middle of the "Christ Hymn" of 1:15–20. The hymn has a balanced poetic structure and should not be divided.
- If we do not divide by grammatical structure, then we should divide by semantic structure.
	- Clear shift of topic and reference occurs between vv.12-13.
	- Verses 9–12 contain the content of his prayer and refer to the actions of the recipients in the second plural. 
	- Verse 13 shifts to the first plural and focuses fully on the Father.
	- The dative phrase describing God in v.12 wraps up the content of his prayer, but also creates a lead-in to further elaborate on "Father" in v.13, that the Father is "the one who rescues us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son whom he loves."
	- Once the Son is mentioned, he gets his own elaboration: "in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins" (1:14).
- Supposing the hymn was preformed, whether planned or not, the mention of Christ's work evokes the hymn, and [[Paul]] continues elaborating on Christ in a poetic fashion.
	- The hymn focuses on Christ in vv.15–18.
	- He is still in view instrumentally in vv. 19–20.
	- The agent of the actions in vv. 19–20 switches to the Father.
	- This switch-reference provides a chiastic structure based on participant reference, which further supports taking vv.13–20 as a unit:
		- Father (v.13)
		- Son (vv.14–18)
		- Father (vv.19–20)
	- Both v.13 and v.20 have the Son as the intermediate agent and use the aorist tense, adding to the chiastic effect.
- Verses 13–20 are therefore a unit, which from a samentic perspective elaborates on the concept of "Father" mentioned in v.12, and the Son through whom He acts.
	- The elaborations function to motivate them to give thanks, and as a result to walk worthily and fulfill his prayer for them.
	- The elaborations are also important for the pragmatic structure, in which this theology, Christology, and soteriology lay motivational grounds for his polemic in the next division (2:4–3:4)
	- His emphasis on Christ's preeminence over the spiritual powers supports later association of the Colossians with the victorious Christ and their necessary dissociation from the defected spiritual powers (2:15, 20; 3:1)
- Observations about the Christ hymn (1:15–20)
	- Up to 19 lexical links and 6 possible thematic links between the hymn and the rest of Colossians (Gordle, *The Colossian Hymn in Context*: 264–267)
	- Serves to help [[Paul]]'s rapport with the Colossians whom he had not met in person (2:1)
	- Two instances of "creation" should be taken to refer to the old creation (1:15) and the new creation (1:18) which sets up hortatory distinction between heavenly things and earthly things (3:1–4) which correlates to life in the old creation (3:5–11) and the new creation (3:12–17)

### Col 1:21-23 - Reconciliation and the Colossians
- Marked by a break from the hymnic structure (1:15–20) and by a fronted ὑμᾶς to signal a switch of focus to the recipients.
- God reconciled (ἀποκαταλλάσσω) "all things" (1:20) is a bit ambiguous, and this reconciliation happened διὰ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ σταυροῦ αὐτοῦ is intellegible but still makes a strange image.
- [[Paul]] begins with καὶ to signal an additional point that his recipients have been reconciled even while they were estranged
	- ἐν τῷ σώματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ διὰ τοῦ θανάτου ("by his fleshly body through his death," 1:22) provides a more concrete image than 1:20.
	- This reconciliation happened in order to present the Colossians "holy and without blemish and blameless before him," which can only happen "if indeed" they remain established and firm in the faith and not shifting from the hope of the gospel which they heard, "which was preached in all creation under heaven, of which I, [[Paul]], became a servant" (1:23).
- This condition (εἴ γε) gives the first hint that there might be a potential or actual problem among the recipients.
	- [[Paul]] tempers the possibility by referring to the hope of "the gospel which you heard," which alludes back to his thanksgiving for their hearing (obeying) of the gospel in 1:5–6
- [[Paul]] could have ended his sentence with "the gospel which you heard," or "which was preached in all creation under heaven," but he appends the additional clause "of which I, [[Paul]], became a servant" to create an opportunity to discuss his apostolic struggles for them.

### Col 1:24–29 - Paul's Stewardship of God's Mystery
- Using his mention of becoming a servant of the gospel as a lead-in, [[Paul]] says he rejoices in his sufferings "for your sake" and continues with a parallel universalized claim (connected by καὶ) that he is compensating in his flesh for what is lacking of the sufferings of Christ "for the sake of his body."
	- The phrase ἀνταναπληρῶ τὰ ὑστερήματα τῶν θλίψεων τοῦ χριστοῦ is difficult but probably means he is compensating for the sufferings Christ would have suffered had he taken on the apostolic task himself. 
	- [[Paul]] thereby connects his apostolic mission and sufferings with the Colossians and the universal body, which connects the two together through his apostolic mission and through Christ, being the "head of the body" (1:28).
	- This rhetorical move bridges the gap between [[Paul]] and the Colossians. It also connects the Colossians to [[Paul]]'s other partner churches by grouping them all together in "the body."
- The mention of the body/church initiates the first of three topic shifts via tail-head linkage using a relative pronoun (ἧς in v.25; οἷς in v.27; and ὃν in v.28, whose antecedents are "church," "saints," and "Christ" respectively).
	- The final expansion on Christ allows him to circle back to his ministry to proclaim Christ for the ultimate purpose of presenting every person mature in Christ (1:28)
	- [[Paul]] adds "unto which I also toil, struggling according to his working that he works powerfully within me" (1:29) to build rapport. The concepts of struggling, toiling, working, and God's power form a nice inclusio with the concepts of suffering and tribulation that began the unit (1:24).
		- ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν (1:24)
		- ὑπὲρ τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ (1:24)
		- εἰς ὑμᾶς (1:25)
		- πάντα ἄνθρωπον (1:28, 3x)
- Three-fold use of "every person" in 1:28 emphasizes again that the Colossians are a part of the larger body, which [[Paul]] serves, so even though he hasn't met them, he is still striving for their benefit.
	- [[Paul]]'s ultimate goal is to present every person mature in Christ which echoes the prominent concern of 1:3–23, that they "walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing" (1:10). 
	- He not only prays that they would do so, but he toils and struggles to make that happen.

### Col 2:1–3 - Paul's Spiritual Struggle
- [[Paul]] continues with a long supporting sentence explaining why he has spoken at length about his apostolic struggle for them, despite the fact that he has met neither them nor their neighboring Laodiceans in person.
	- He wants them to know about his apostolic struggle so that they might be encourage toward two results: (1) being united in love, and (2) having all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, the knowledge of the mystery of God, namely Christ.
	- [[Paul]] wants his ministry to encourage them which will result in unity and knowledge of Christ.
- [[Paul]] is helping to fulfill his own prayer that they continue increasing in the knowledge of God (1:10), which will help them walk worthily (1:10).
- In 2:3, [[Paul]] appends that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, a brief allusion toward the following unit, which will turn to the problem of wisdom and knowledge in [[Colossae]].
