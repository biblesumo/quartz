## Colossians Macrostructure
### Semantic Macrostructure
- "We want you to live worthily as people saved by the Father through his preeminent Son according to the gospel, of which I am a minister suffering for you. Therefore, desire heavenly things where Christ is, not earthly regulations promoted by the defected spiritual powers. Do so by renouncing your old nature and living according to your newly created nature, even in the home. Finally, pray for us, be wise and gracious, and greet the brothers for us."

### Pragmatic Macrostructure
- "[[Paul]] writes to the Colossians to exalt Christ as preeminent over the spiritual powers and to relate his apostolic struggles on their behalf, so that he can convince them to reject the false teaching and continue in the faith as they received it, so that ultimately he might recruit further partner churches to support his ministry."
- Such a view does not nullify the discussions about the centrality of the Colossian philosophy for [[Paul]]'s communicative purpose, but it does claim a more ultimate purpose in writing that connects the letter more concretely to [[Paul]]'s own mission.

### Division 1 (1:3–2:3)
- Preparatory and grounding discourse
- "We keep praying that you would live as a believer should, giving thanks to the Father who saved you through Christ by the gospel, of which I am a minister. And I rejoice in my ministerial sufferings for your sake and the church's, which I hope will encourage you."
#### Section 1.1 - Paul's Thanksgiving (1:3–8)
- "We thank God for your faith, hope, and love, which we heard about through [[Epaphras]], and which are increasing in you and in all the world."
#### Section 1.2 - Paul's Intercession (1:9–12)
- Section 1.1 is the basis for Section 1.2. Therefore, Section 1.2 is more semantically prominent. 
- "We keep praying that you would be filled with knowledge about God, in order that you might live as a believer should, giving thanks to the Father."
#### Section 1.3 - The Supremacy of Christ (1:13–20)
- Sections 1.3–1.4 together serve as an elaboration of "Father" in Col 1:12 in Section 1.2.
- "The Father redeemed us and reconciled all things through Christ, who is preeminent over the first and the new creation, because all things were created through him and because God's fullness dwells in him."
#### Section 1.4 - Reconciliation and the Colossians (1:21–23)
- Section 1.4 is a specific application to the audience of the soteriological terms in Section 1.3.
- "You were reconciled to God through Christ's sacrifice despite your hostility toward him, in order that he might present you blameless before himself if you remain faithful to the gospel, of which I am a minister."
#### Section 1.5 - Paul's Stewardship of God's Mystery (1:24–29)
 - Sections 1.5–1.6 are connected to Sections 1.1–1.4 by a "tail-head linkage." [[Paul]] pivots from the gospel to his own preaching of the gospel and, by implication, his own suffering on their behalf through his apostolic ministry of preaching.
 - "I rejoice to struggle for your sake and the church's, as God's servant, to fully preach the gospel in order to present every person mature in Christ."
#### Section 1.6 - Paul's Spiritual Struggle (2:1–3)
- Section 1.6 provides an explanation of why [[Paul]] wrote Section 1.5.
- "I want you to know about my struggles for your sake in order that your hearts might be encouraged so that you are united in love and toward the knowledge of Christ."

### Division 2 (2:4–3:4)
- Polemic against the Colossian philosophy
- "Continue in the faith you originally received and reject any deceptive teaching regarding earthly rituals and mystic visions, because you belong to Christ, who has defected the spiritual powers associated with such regulations. So, desire heavenly things, not such earthly things."
#### Section 2.1 - Warning against Sophistry (2:4–5)
- "What I am about to say, I say in order that you will not be deceived by sophistry, and I hope it will be effective even though this is through a letter."
#### Section 2.2 - Continue in the Faith (2:6–7)
- "Continue in the faith that you were originally taught."
#### Section 2.3 - Christ, the Remedy against Error (2:8-15)
- "Be careful that no one captivates you with their false teaching, because Christ embodies God's full presence, as do you because you are united to and made alive with Christ."
#### Section 2.4 - Warning against Rituals (2:16–17)
- "Do not let anyone judge you regarding earthly rituals, because they are supposed to point us to Christ."
#### Section 2.5 - Warning against Mystic Visions (2:18–19)
- "Do not let those who delight in mystic visions of heavenly worship disqualify you from the faith, because they have abandoned Christ."
#### Section 2.6 - Reject Earthly Regulations (2:20–23)
- It is senseless to belong to the body of Christ and yet submit to regulations associated with spiritual powers whom Christ has defeated.
#### Section 2.7 - Seek Heavenly Things (3:1–4)
- "Desire heavenly things, not earthly things, because you died with Christ and your future resurrection is secure in him."

### Division 3 (3:5–4:1)
- Hortatory material on how to live instead
- "Renounce sinfulness and live according to your new nature as part of the new creation. And do so specifically in the home."
#### Section 3.1 - Put Off Vices (3:5–11)
- "Renounce sinfulness because you are part of the new creation, where Christ is what matters most."
#### Section 3.2 - Put On Virtues (3:12–17)
- "Live according to your new nature, especially showing love, peace, and thankfulness."
#### Section 3.3 - Household Relationships (3:18–4:1)
- "Fulfill your relational obligations at home in the Lord."

### Division 4 (4:2–17)
- Closing instructions to further [[Paul]]'s communicative purpose
- "Pray for our ministry, act wisely and graciously as you reject false teaching, and greet the brothers for us, including those of [[Laodicea]], with whom you should exchange letters."
#### Section 4.1 - Prayer and Witness (4:2–6)
- "Pray for our ministry, and act wisely and graciously as your rejection of false teaching leads to disputes."
#### Section 4.2 - Greetings and Exhortation (4:7–17)
- "I and my co-workers send greetings to you and to the church in [[Laodicea]], with whom you should exchange letters."
