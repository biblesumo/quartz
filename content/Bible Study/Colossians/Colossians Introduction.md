## Author
- [[Paul]] (1:1, 23; 4:18)
- Refers to [[Timothy]], [[Epaphras]], John Mark, and Barnabas (companions of [[Paul]] in book of Acts)
- Affirmed by "unbroken testimony of the early church"
- Objections began with German scholar Theodor Mayerhoff in 1838 based on (1) language/vocabulary and literary style, (2) theology, and (3) close relationship of Colossians to Ephesians. 
	- Contains 34 hapax legomena and 28 other words that do not appear in [[Paul]]'s other letters.
- [[Paul]]’s authorship primarily rests on the strength of four pillars: 
	1. Letter’s own claim to authenticity
	2. Unbroken tradition throughout church history
		- Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Murutorian Fragment 
	3. Close connections between Colossians and Philemon, a letter which almost all accept as authentic
	4. Questions surrounding the practice and acceptance of pseudonymity.
	- Moo p.28-41, O'Brien xli-xlix, Barth-Blanke p.114-26
## Date
- Around AD 60
- Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon belong together to the same time and situation.
	- Close link between Colossians and Philemon
	- Tychicus is sent as bearer of both Colossians (Col 4:7-8) and Ephesians (Eph 6:21-22)
	- In contrast, Philippians does not include personal references apart from mention of [[Timothy]]. [[Paul]] was uncertain about his future when he wrote Philippians (Phil 1:19-26; 2:17, 24)
- Earthquake may have destroyed [[Colossae]] in AD 60-61.
- "[[Colossae]] lost its cultural importance through an earthquake in 61.” 
## Provenance
- 3 Possibilities
	- Ephesus during 3.5 years spent there (Acts 19:10, 22; 20:31) between fall of AD 52 to Spring 56.
	- Caesarea-on-the-Sea, where he spent two years in enforced confinement (Acts 24:23, 27) between May AD 57 to September 59.
	- Rome where he was under "house-arrest" for "two whole years" (Acts 28:30-31) between February AD 60 to late 61 or early 62.
- Traditional View: Imprisonment in Rome (Moo p.41-46)
- "The presence of Luke, Aristarchus, [[Timothy]], and other coworkers with [[Paul]] at the time of writing are important clues for the provenance for Rome."
- "Acts places Luke with [[Paul]] in Rome, while [[Paul]]’s Ephesian ministry is not one of the “we” passages in Acts."
- "Acts 27:2 also indicates that Aristarchus accompanied [[Paul]] to Italy and most likely all the way to Rome."
## Destination
- [[Colossae]] (undisputed according to Dunn)
- [[Colossae]] was the least important city to which any of [[Paul]]'s letters is addressed. (Porter)
- Lycus Valley (modern day Turkey): provided plenty of food for grazing sheep, and the wool from these flocks supported a large clothing industry. 
- [[Laodicea]] and Hierapolis eclipsed [[Colossae]] by the time of [[Paul]]. All destroyed by earthquake in AD 61, but [[Laodicea]] was rebuilt (Rev 3:14-22).
## Occasion
- When [[Paul]] wrote the letter, [[Paul]] had not visited the church (Col 1:4, 8; 2:1), although he was hoping to do so (Phlm 22).
- He may have passed through [[Colossae]] on his third missionary journey (Acts 18:23; 19:1).
- [[Colossae]] was the least important city to which any of [[Paul]]’s letters is addressed (Porter 354).
- [[Paul]] addressed a false teaching some have called the “[[Colossian Heresy]].” 
- False teaching that minimize the person and work of Christ.
- Col 2:8-9, 11, 13, 16, 18-23
- I. K. Smith surveyed four main proposals: (1) Essene Judaism and Gnosticism, (2) Hellenism, (3) paganism, and (4) Judaism.
- Summary: "Perhaps all one can conclude at this point is that [[Paul]] faced some form of Jewish legalism and mysticism."
## Purpose
- Combat false teaching with the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ.
- Argues for supremacy of Christ, sufficiency of his work for the believer, and the application of Christ's lordship to every aspect of the Christian life.
- "Most would acknowledge that [[Paul]] made at least three main points in Colossians: (1) all the fullness dwells in the preeminent Christ (1:15–20); (2) believers are complete in Christ (2:10); and thus (3) they should seek to know more of Christ in his fullness by seeking the things above where he dwells, not the things on the earth (3:1–2)."
## Literary Plan
- "Colossians is written for the purpose of exhortation and encouragement. It seems best to divide the text along epistolary lines that conform to the common Pauline tendency to begin with a doctrinal section and end with a paraenetic (hortatory) section."
- [[Colossians Macrostructure]]
## Themes
- Gratitude to Christ for the great salvation serves as motiviation for the Christian life.
### Supremacy of Christ
- Christ’s preeminence comes to the forefront especially in 1:15–20, which contains one of the most exalted depictions of Christ in the entire NT.
- Range of terminology to describe Jesus
	- "Christ Jesus" (1:1)
	- "our Lord Jesus Christ" (1:3)
	- "his beloved Son" (1:13)
	- "image of the invisible God" (1:15)
	- "firstborn of all creation" (1:15)
	- "the head of the body, the church" (1:18)
### Proper Christian Conduct
- First, the complete scope of Christ’s sufficient work and believers’ spiritual union with him means that they can keep pursuing the things above where Christ dwells (3:1–2).
- Second, union with Christ means that the believer is a new creature and acts accordingly. The believer has “put off the old man with his practices” (3:9) and has “put on the new man” (3:10).
- Third, the cosmic scope of Christ’s lordship has staggering implications for his lordship over every aspect of the believer’s life, which is especially emphasized in the household code in 3:18–4:1.57 Christ’s lordship extends to one’s personal holiness, family life, work life, and everything in between (“whatever you do, in word or in deed,” 3:17).
## Similarities between Colossians and Ephesians

- Col 1:3–11 and Eph 1:3–18
- Col 1:23–2:5 and Eph 3:1–13
- Col 3:5–4:1 and Eph 4:17–6:9
- Col 4:2–4 and Eph 6:18–20
