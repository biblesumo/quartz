## [[Paul]]'s Thanksgiving (1:3–8)

- These verses, which express [[Paul]]'s thanksgiving for the Colossians, form one single sentence in Greek. 
- Most Greek editions print a semicolon after verse six.

### Col 1:3

 Εὐχαριστοῦμεν τῷ θεῷ πατρὶ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ
 - "We give thanks to God"
	 - Εὐχαριστοῦμεν is a 1st person *plural* active indicative followed by dative τῷ θεῷ
	 - Imperfective aspect modified by πάντοτε depicts an iterative action. (Campbell 3)
	 - Option A: Subject (plural) could be [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]] ([[Colossians 1_1–2#Col 1 1|Col 1:1]])
		 - It refers to [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]] (Alford, BECNT, Eadie, NICNT, NTC, USB Handbook, WBC) and to others of [[Paul]]’s colleagues (ZECNT, USB Handbook, WBC) and to the church where [[Paul]] was at the time of writing. The reference to [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]] continues throughout this paragraph and the following one. It continues throughout the entire epistle, wherever first-person plural occurs [Alford].
	 - Option B: [[Paul]] is using the epistolary plural (Rom 1:5; 1 Thes 2:18)
		 - Literary or sociative or authorial plural or the “plural of modesty”
		 - Switch back to singular verb in 1:23-24 suggests this is not the case (Pao, Moule)
		 - References: BDF §280; Roberson p.406–7; Turner p.28; Wallace p.394–96; Zerwick §8; and Barth-Blanke 166–68; Harris, _2 Cor_. 139–41
 - "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ"
	 - Both τοῦ κυρίου … Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ and ἡμῶν are possessive genitives, the former (τοῦ κυρίου) denoting a filial relationship. The latter, ἡμῶν, is a genitive of subordination (Campbell 3). Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ is a genitive in apposition to τοῦ κυρίου.
	 - Similar formula to "Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom 1:4; 1 Cor 1:9) and "Christ Jesus our Lord" (1 Tim 1:2; 2 Tim 1:2)
	 - "Lord" is reference to Greek OT translation of Yahweh in the LXX (Beale 34; Fee)
 - What does [[Paul]] thank God for?
	 - He thanks God for the Colossians: we thank God for you. He thanks God for the good things he has heard about them, for their faith and love and hope enumerated in the following two verses, for their Christian virtues, for the progress in their Christian lives and their holiness, for what God has done in their lives, and for all that God has given them.

πάντοτε
- Temporal adverb
 - "always"
	 - Option A: πάντοτε probably construed with "give thanks" and not "praying for you." 
		 - "we always thank God... when we pray for you" (ZECNT; ESV, NIV)
		  1. Similar formula to 1 Cor 1:4; Phil 1:3-4; 1 Thes 1:2; 2 Thes 1:3; Phlm 4; Eph 1:16; 5:20
		  2. NT Greek, adverb generally follows the verb it modifies (Turner 227–228)
		  3. προσευχόμενοι restricts the meaning of πάντοτε
	  - Option B: πάντοτε modifies the participle προσευχόμενοι
		  - "we always pray for you and thank God"
		  - Alford, BECNT, NICNT, KJV, NASB, LSB

περὶ ὑμῶν προσευχόμενοι
  - "praying for you"
	  - Nominative plural masculine (agreeing with the plural subject in εὐχαριστοῦμεν) of present middle participle of deponent προσεύχομαί pray
		  - Imperfective aspect implicates a contemporaneous action.
	  - Adverbial participle of time (“when we pray”), denoting action simultaneous with the main verb (εὐχαριστοῦμεν).
	  - Περὶ ὑμῶν could be taken with the main verb (“we give thanks for you,” NJB), especially given its position (cf.Rom 1:8), but it probably belongs with προσευχόμενοι
	  - Περί (“for”) here and in Col 4:3 and in Phlm 10 means “on behalf of” rather than “concerning”; the prepositions περί and ὑπέρ are often interchangeable (BDF §229 [1]; Turner p.270; Zerwick §96; see Eph 1:16; 6:18–19).
	  - In other words, "whenever [[Paul]] prayed for the Colossians, he always gave thanks for them."

### Col 1:4

ἀκούσαντες τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν
- "since we heard"
	- ἀκούσαντες is the nominative plural masculine (agreeing with the plural subject in εὐχαριστοῦμεν) of aorist active participle ἀκούω, hear.
		- Perfective aspect implicates antecedent action.
		- Adverbial participle expressing cause
		- Causal circumstantial participle providing the basis of [[Paul]]'s thanksgiving (Pao 51)
		- Burton §439; Robertson p.112
	- takes the accusative instead of genitive with no apparent difference in meaning (Pao, Wallace 133)
	- Aorist participles that express antecedent action generally precede the main verb but sometimes follow it, as here (Burton §§134, 136; Robertson p.860)
- "of your faith"
	- τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν... καὶ τὴν ἀγάπην is a compound noun phrase functioning as the accusative direct object of ἀκούσαντες
	- Points to trust in and acceptance of Jesus and his gospel. [[Paul]] is insistent that faith itself is an act of God. (Pao 51)

ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ
- "in Christ Jesus"
	1. After πίστις this phrase could denote the object of their faith (similarly Col 2:5; Bruce 41; Lightfoot 133; Campbell)
	2. This phrase indicates the sphere or realm in which their faith operated or was evident (Pao 51; Moo 84; Moule 81; Turner 263n2; Harris "Prepositions and Theology in the Greek New Testament." NIDNTT 3:1171-1215) "your faith as those who are in Christ Jesus."
		- They have the kind of faith exercised by those who are incorporated in Christ. (NICNT)

καὶ τὴν ἀγάπην ἥν ἔχετε εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους
- "and the love which you have for all the saints"
	- An accusative singular female of relative pronoun ὅς, ἥ, ὅ, referring to τὴν ἀγάπην. 
		- “which you show (toward . . .),” a stronger expression than the ὑμῶν with τὴν πίστιν (4a). 
		- “To all God’s people (without exception),” whereas τοὺς πάντας ἁγίους would convey the sense “all God’s people (regarded as a whole),” the entire Christian brotherhood.
	- ἔχετε
		- Present active indicative 2nd plural ἔχω. Imperfective aspect here implicates a stative Aktionsart.
	- The attributive ὁ πᾶς or οἱ πάντες focuses attention on the sum total rather than the constituent parts
	- In the predicate position with an articular noun (as here), πᾶς means “all (without exception).” 
		- BDF §275; Turner 199–201; Zerwick §§188–91
	- ἀγάπη is to be shown first to other believers, then to all people (1 Thess 3:12; Gal 6:10)
	- εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους. Direction (BDAG, 290.4.c.β).

### Col 1:5

διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα
- "because of the hope"
- This phrase, which specifies ground or cause (διά + accusative, “on account of”), may be related to (A) τὴν πίστιν . . . καὶ τὴν ἀγάπην or (B) τὴν ἀγάπην.
	- Option A (Preferred): the preceding object of ἀκούσαντες is twofold and parallel: “both (namely, faith and love) spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven” 
		- It indicates the reason for their faith and love (Campbell 4, Moule 49, NICNT, TNTC, USB, WBC, ZECNT; NIV, NLT): you have faith and you love all the saints because of the hope you have. Hope strengthens and intensifies faith and love. Knowing what God has in store for us in the future motivates us to be steadfast in faith and to practice sacrificial love. It is what enables us to do this. It produces stronger faith and deeper love.
	- Option B: to restrict διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα to its nearest antecedent
		- It indicates the reason for their love: you love all the saints because of the hope you have. The common hope we have with all the saints inspires us to love them.
	- Option C: It indicates, along with their faith and love, the reason for [[Paul]]’s thanksgiving (Eadie, KJV): we thank God for your faith and love, and for the hope which is laid up for you. Thinking of the hope laid up for them was what brought the feeling of thankfulness to [[Paul]] for their faith and love. That hope is the end result of their faith and love.
- Unlike πίστις and ἀγάπη, ἐλπίς is here objective, not subjective, in sense: 
	- in this verse hope is not an inward disposition but rather denotes, by metonymy, the objective of hope (CEV; Barth-Blanke 170–72) (almost = inheritance, cf. 1 Pet 1:4; or = “eternal life,” cf. Titus 1:2 and H. Traub, TDNT 5:532n294)
	- “the ‘hope’ is the totality of blessing that awaits the Christian in the life to come” (BDAG 113a). An objective fact produces subjective attitudes. The inheritance of Christians has the effect of stimulating in them stronger faith and deeper love. 
	- [[Paul]] is not suggesting that hope initially produces faith or love, for only the person with Christian faith can have Christian love (Gal 5:6) or “hope.” 
	- For this use of ἐλπίς denoting what is hoped for (BDAG 320c, 739b; Barth-Blanke 154), see also Gal 5:5; Titus 2:13; Heb 6:18; and Rom 8:24, where both the subjective and objective senses of ἐλπίς occur (see further Turner, Words 213–15). “So your faith and love are based on what you hope for.”
	- It is what is hoped for, our eternal inheritance, our heavenly reward, salvation in its future sense, the treasure in heaven mentioned in the gospels, eternal life, heaven, the content of the gospel, and even Jesus himself. It indicates something sure and real, a confident expectation of what is hoped for, so sure that it creates the emotion of hope in a Christian’s heart , and not merely a longing without sure basis. It includes waiting with patience for something good to happen. Parallels Col 1:23.

τὴν ἀποκειμένην ὑμῖν ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς

- ἀποκειμένην is accusative singular feminine (agreeing with τὴν ἐλπίδα) present (mid./ pass.) participle of ἀποκεῖμαι, be stored up.
	- with dative (here ὑμῖν), be reserved for (cf.2 Tim 4:8). On this “present perfect” verb, see Turner 81–82; Robertson 316. 
	- This articular participle is restrictive in meeting. (cf.Burton §§295, 422 and see the Glossary under “Articular Participle”). 
	- It qualifies a noun (τὴν ἐλπίδα) and is equivalent to a relative clause (cf. BDF§412; Robertson 764, 1106–8; Turner 152), namely, ἣ ἀπόκειται, “which is stored up,” as is shown by the following ἣν προηκούσατε. 
		- the object of the hope which is laid up.
	- The implied actor of ἀποκειμένην 'laid up' is God: which is laid up for you by God.
- ὑμῖν. dative of advantage.
- Ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς, “in heaven” (most EVV), not “in the heavens” (Revised Version 1881; Dunn 59–60), although there were multiple heavens in OT and Jewish thought. 
	- The plural οὐρανοι, is often used in the LXX to translate the Hebrew plural form _šāmayim_, “heaven(s),” “sky” (H. Bietenhard, NIDNTT 2:191; H. Traub, TDNT 5:509–11, 513; Turner 25; cf. Robertson 408; Turner, _Words_ 202–5).

ἥν προηκούσατε

- ἥν. Accusative direct object of προηκούσατε, with τὴν ἐλπίδα as the antecedent.
- προηκούσατε is the 2 plural aorist active indicative of προακούω, hear beforehand.
	- Accusative singular feminine of relative pronoun ὅς, ἥ, ὅ, referring to τὴν ἐλπίδα (fem. sg.).  
		- Perfective aspect here implicates a summary Aktionsart
	- Like “hear” in English, ἀκούω can mean “receive news of” or “be informed about” as well as referring to the physical sensation of hearing (cf. BDAG 38b). 
	- The προ- may refer to a time: 
		1. Best option: when they first heard the gospel (v. 7) (“previously,” NASB2). 
			- This hope was always preached as part of the gospel. This may imply a contrast with the false teaching, which they had only recently heard.
		2. before the time of writing (“already,” NAB2, TNIV)
			- Wilson (89) believes “the reference is surely just to some earlier date, unspecified”; so also Dunn (60), “earlier.”
		3. “before” the Colossians heard the false teaching (Moule)
		4. “before” the fulfillment of the hope. They have heard it before the hope is realized. (Lange, Meyer)

ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας τοῦ εὐαγγελίου

- As a general rule, dependent nouns (here ἀληθείας and εὐαγγελίου) are articular if the governing noun has the articular and are anarthrous if the governing noun lacks the article (e.g., διὰ θελήματος θεοῦ, v. 1; and note ἐν λόγῳ ἀληθείας in 2 Cor 6:7). This is the so-called canon of Apollonius Dyscolus.
- Ἐν
	1. locative (“in”). It indicates that the hope is an important part of the gospel: the hope, which is contained in the message of the gospel. (Lange, Meyer)
	2. temporal (“when”). It indicates the time at which they heard: the hope you heard about when the true word came to you. This means that the word they heard gave them information about the hope.
	3. instrumental (“by means of, through”). It indicates the means by which they heard: the hope which you heard about through the word. (Campbell)
- Λόγος may mean “word, message” or “proclamation, preaching.” 
- In general, τῆς ἀληθείας may be:
	1. Best option: Qualitative (= attributive, Hebrew Semetic; “the message of truth” = the message characterized by truth, “the true message”; or “the true preaching”; Campbell 4)
		- See BDF §165; Robertson 496–97; Turner 212–14; Zerwick §§40–41. 
	1. Epexegetic/appositional (“the message, which is truth” for this use, see BDF §167; Robertson 498–99; Turner 214–15; Zerwick §§45–46)
	2. Objective (“the proclamation of the truth”; for this use, see BDF §163; Robertson 499–501; Turner 210–12; Zerwick §36)
- Genitive τοῦ εὐαγγελίου 
	1. Epexegetic so that either ἀλήθεια = εὐαγγέλιον or λόγος ἀληθείας = εὐαγγέλιον, i.e., either “the proclamation of the truth, which is contained in the gospel,” i.e., gospel truth, or (as in Eph 1:13) “the message of truth, the gospel,” “the true message, that is, the gospel.”
		- "Gospel" is a restatement of "the word of truth." (NICNT, WBC, NASB, NIV)
		- "Truth" is an attribute of "word:" the true word, i.e., the gospel.
		- "Truth" is the contents of the "word:" the word which contains the truth, i.e., the gospel. 
	2. Possessive (“the proclamation of the truthfulness that belongs to the gospel,” i.e., the true gospel; for this use, see BDF §162; R 495–96; T 207–8)

### Col 1:6

τοῦ παρόντος εἰς ὑμᾶς

- παρόντος is genitive singular neuter (agreeing with τοῦ εὐαγγελίου) and the present active participle of πάρειμι, be present, have come. 
	- An articular participle is equivalent to a relative clause (see on τὴν ἀποκειμένην, 1:5). 
		- "The gospel, which has come to you"
		- It is the first of several statements regarding the gospel.
	- Here the participle is attributive and (nonrestrictive or explanatory), describing something (namely, the gospel) already known (cf. Burton §§295, 426; Campbell 4). 
	- The phrase is usually taken to mean “that has come to you” (BDAG 773d), but it could possibly also mean “that is present among you” (Lohse 19nn 53, 54), although [[Paul]] is not prone to use εἰς in the sense of ἐν (see Zerwick §§106–10, but note also Zerwick’s earlier suggestion that, following Classical Greek usage, where εἰς is sometimes used with verbs of rest (Zerwick §9), εἰς here bears a “pregnant” sense, implying a preceding arrival of the gospel (_Analysis_ 447); cf. E. Stauffer, TDNT 2:433).
- εἰς ὑμᾶς. Spatial.

καθὼς καὶ ἐν παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ

- Καθὼς καί, “just as also,” “in the same way, too” (two occurrences in this verse). Introduces a comparison.
	1. Preferred: It indicates that not only was the gospel proclaimed in [[Colossae]], but it was proclaimed in all places (KJV), with the same effectiveness that it had in [[Colossae]]]. [[Paul]] goes from the specific to the wider view. He enlarges the scope of the participle ‘coming’ to include not only the Colossians but the whole world, and he enlarges its meaning to include fruitbearing and growth (Alford; NASB). He compares the coming of the gospel to [[Colossae]] with its fruitbearing and growth in the world.
	2. It indicates that the same gospel which is with the Colossians is also in the whole world; thus, it is worthy of their trust and needs no substitute.
	3. It indicates that the gospel is present in all the world, but the change of prepositions indicates that there is also a contrast, that the gospel has not yet accomplished all its work in the whole world, as it has in [[Colossae]].
- In Pauline writings, comparative clauses generally follow the principal clause (Turner 345). 
	- There is a question as to whether [[Paul]] is making one or two comparisons in this verse. None of the commentaries consulted comes out clearly in favor of only one. However, five of the versions have only one. Four of these include only the comparison with the Colossians (CEV, NIV, NRSV, TEV): the gospel has come to you; it is bearing fruit and growing in all the world, just as it is among you. The other one includes only the comparison with the world (NAB): the gospel has come to you and is bearing fruit and growing among you, just as it is in all the world. One commentary includes only the comparison with the Colossians in its translation, but in the commentary part comes out very clearly in favor of two comparisons (WBC): the gospel has come to you, just as it has in all the world, bearing fruit and growing, just as it is doing among you. The other commentaries which come out clearly in favor of two comparisons are Alford, Eadie, Nicoll, ICC, Lt, Meyer, Callow, TNTC. The second comparison, ‘just as it is doing among you’, is an afterthought to express [[Paul]]’s appreciation of their progress.
- On articular πᾶς, see [[Colossians 1_3–8#Col 1:4|1:4]]. 
- ἐν παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ
	1. It is a hyperbole, meaning that the gospel had spread extensively over the world, especially in the cities of the Roman Empire, from where it would spread further. It means all the countries of the world they knew, the Greco-Roman word. 
		- “In the entire world” (NET), “the whole world over” (REB) is clearly a hyperbole emphasizing the widespread dissemination of the gospel (e.g., 1:23b), especially via the cities of the empire, in a type of “representative universalism” (cf. Acts 2:5; Rom 10:18). See O’Brien 13; Barth-Blanke 158 and n. 26. “Heresies are at best ethnic: truth is essentially catholic” (Lightfoot 133).
	2. It means that the spread of the gospel will not stop with any one nation or country but is a force which will spread throughout the entire world, which it was already rapidly doing. The phrase speaks of the universality of the gospel and is a practical reference to Jesus’ command to go into all the world.

ἐστὶν καρποφορούμενον

- Periphrastic present (Robertson 881; Robertson, _Pictures_ 474; Turner 88): 3 singular present active indicative of εἰμί + nominative singular neuter (agreeing with an implied τὸ εὐαγγέλιον [from v. 5b], the subject of ἐστίν) of the present middle participle of καρποφορέω, bear fruit. 
	- If this periphrastic present differs in emphasis from a regular present, it does so by pointing to the continuous nature of the gospel’s productivity, its ongoing action: it “continues to bear fruit” or “is constantly bearing fruit” (NASB2; similarly Barth-Blanke 1, 157–58) or “has been bearing fruit” (note the following ἀφ̓ ἧς ἡμέρας). 
- In v. 10 the present _active_ participle of the same verb is found (καρποφοροῦντες). Some find no distinction in meaning (e.g., Turner 55), but the middle participle may imply the intrinsic potency of the gospel in producing its own fruit (cf. Rom 1:16): “bearing fruit of itself” (similarly BDAG 510c; Lightfoot 133; Zerwick, _Analysis_ 447).
- It is not impossible to read ἔστιν, καρποφορούμενον (i.e., with a break after ἔστιν) and translate v. 6a thus: “(the gospel) that is present among you just as it is also in the whole world, where it is constantly producing fruit.” On this view (cf. Zerwick, _Analysis_ 447), the participle and the following present participle αὐξανόμενον are in apposition to the implied τὸ εὐαγγέλιον and are not the participle elements of a periphrastic construction.
- In order to highlight the parallelism between “to/among you” and “throughout/in the whole world,” a few manuscripts and the Textus Receptus read καί before ἐστὶν καρποφορούμενον κτλ. But this removal of a somewhat awkward comparison (namely, between the arrival or presence of the gospel in [[Colossae]] and its productivity and spread throughout the world) is clearly secondary.  (Metzger 552)
- What is meant by the gospel αὐξανόμενον ‘growing’?
	1. The gospel is spreading throughout the world and an increasing number of people are believing it. More and more people are hearing it.
	2. ‘Growing’ is still referring to the work the gospel is doing within the individual believer. It means the growth of the faith and love referred to in [[Colossians 1_3–8#Col 1:4|1:4]]. The two participles ‘bearing fruit’ and ‘growing’ form one concept and are not to be considered as two separate things.

καὶ αὐξανόμενον καθὼς καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν

- Periphrastic present: (τὸ εὐαγγέλιον) ἐστὶν … αὐξανόμενον. Nominative singular neuter of present passive participle of αὐξάνω, cause to grow; (pass.) grow. 
- “The Gospel is not like those plants which exhaust themselves in bearing fruit and wither away. The external growth keeps pace with the reproductive energy” (Lightfoot 133). 
- On καθὼς καί, see earlier on v. 6a. 
- What relationship is indicated by καθὼς καί ‘just as also’?
	1. It brings the thought back from the fruitbearing and growing of the gospel in the whole world to its fruitbearing and growing in [[Colossae]]. [[Paul]] wants to be sure to include the Colossians when he uses these two participles. The same thing that was happening in other places was also happening in Colosse and thus confirmed what was happening in the other places.
	2. It brings the thought back from the worldwide proclamation and effectiveness of the gospel to the time when it was introduced in [[Colossae]]. [[Colossae]] was a part of the vast region where the gospel was present and working, and this confirmed its presence and working in the other parts of the world. The difference in the two interpretations is that the first one includes only the fruitbearing and growing, while this second one includes also the coming of the gospel, or its proclamation.
- Ἐν ὑμῖν here does not mean “within you” but “(It has had the same effect) among you” (NJB), “in your midst” (NAB¹), and refers to both the past and the present (“as it does among you and has done,” REB), given the following phrase.

ἀφ̓ ἧς ἡμέρας

- Temporal, indicating the point from which something begins.
- This is an idiomatic form of ἀφʼ ἡμέρας ᾗ, “from the day on which” = “ever since” (Cassirer). 
- The dative singular feminine relative pronoun ᾗ is attracted into the case of its antecedent (ἡμέρας, genitive), which then is transferred to the relative clause (cf. Zerwick, _Analysis_ 447; Zerwick §§17–18; Robertson 717). The phrase functions like a conjunction (“since”; Turner 17; Robertson 978).

ῆκούσατε καὶ ἐπέγνωτε

- 2 plural aorist active indicative ἀκούω, hear; learn of, be informed about. 
	- Perfective aspect implicates a summary Aktionsart
- What is the object of ῆκούσατε 'heard'?
	- Preferred: Its object is the gospel (NICNT, WBC; KJV, NASB, NIV, NRSV): from the day you heard the gospel and understood the grace of God.
	- Its object is grace (NJB, NLT): from the day you both heard and understood the grace of God.
- Ἐπέγνωτε, 2 plural aorist active indicative of ἐπιγινώσκω, know, learn, perceive. 
	- Perfective aspect with a stative lexeme creates an ingressive Aktionsart, so that the verb depicts entrance into the state ("to recognize, come to know"). (Campbell 5)
	- Ingressive aorist, “you came to know” (similarly Moffatt, Goodspeed). Some give the preposition prefix ἐπι- its full weight and render it by “completely,” “fully,” “truly” (cf. BDAG 369a; “truly comprehended,” NRSV; Lightfoot 134, 135–36), but a comparison of v. 6 with 2 Cor 8:9 (γινώσκετε . . . τὴν χάριν κτλ.) shows that there is no necessary difference in meaning between ἐπιγινώσκειν and γινώσκειν (R. Bultmann, TDNT 1:703–4; cf. MM 236–37). Moreover, Hellenistic Greek was marked by a tendency to prefer the more explicit expression and the fuller and phonetically stronger form, so that compound verbs became more frequent and yet often meant no more than the corresponding simple verbs had meant in Classical Greek. (Zerwick §§481–84; cf. Zerwick, _Analysis_ 447).

τὴν χάριν τοῦ θεοῦ

- Accusative τὴν χάριν is probably the objective of both preceding verbs ἠκούσατε καὶ ἐπέγνωτε. (Barth-Blanke 1; Dunn 54), but it is possible to supply τὸ εὐαγγέλιον (from v. 5b) as the objective of ἠκούσατε (so HCSB, NET). 
- The genitive τοῦ θεοῦ may be possessive (“God’s grace”) or subjective (“the grace that God has shown”); cf. Acts 20:24; 2 Cor 6:1. 
	- On either view, “the grace of God” is here virtually a synonym for “the gospel”; but NEB has “graciousness,” NAB1 “gracious intention,” TCNT “loving-kindness,” Cassirer “gracious favour,” and CEV “wonderful kindness.”
	- Genitive of source (Campbell 5)

ἐν ἀληθείᾳ

- In meaning probably adverbial (“in reality,” “for what it really is”; cf. BDAG 42d, 43a) rather than adjectival with χάριν (“the true grace of God”) or substantive (“in the truth” [HCSB], i.e., in the gospel; cf. v. 5). 
- Dative of rule: "according to the standard of truth." (Campbell 5)
- What does the phrase ἐν ἀληθείᾳ ‘in truth’ modify?
	1. It modifies the noun 'grace.' 
		- It describes grace: God's grace which is true. 
		- **Preferred** - It refers to the genuine character of grace (NIV): God's grace as it really is. They came to appreciate God's grace for what it truly is. They learned the truth about God's grace.
	2. It modifies the verb ‘understood’ (NRSV): you truly understood God’s grace. They truly experienced God’s grace.
	3. It modifies the verbs ‘heard’ and ‘understood’, but is not to be understood as a simple adverb (Lange): the message was proclaimed to you in sincerity and as it really is, and you accepted it that way.
	4. It modifies both the noun ‘grace’ and the verb ‘understood’, but is neither to be understood as an adverbial modifying of the verb or as an adjectival modifying of the noun (Alford): true knowledge of the gospel as it really is.
	5. It adds another object to ‘understand’ (NICNT): you understood God’s grace and truth. They came to know the grace and truth that came through Christ [NIC].
- The contrast with the travesty of God’s grace in the false teaching propounded at [[Colossae]] is implicit but nonetheless unmistakable.

### Col 1:7

καθὼς ἐμάθετε

- 2 plural aorist active indicative of μανθάνω, learn (through instruction; BDAG 615b). 
	- Perfective aspect here implicates a summary Aktionsart.
- What relationship is indicated by καθώς ‘as’?
	1. It indicates comparison (NASB): you heard and understood the gospel in truth, just as you learned it from [[Epaphras]].
		- Since the temporal meaning (“when”) of καθώς is rare in the NT (only in Acts 7:17), the word here, as in v. 6, bears its usual sense of “just as,” introducing a comparative, but without any accompanying οὕτως, “so” (e.g., 3:13; BDAG 493c,d).
	2. It explains how they heard the gospel (WBC; NIV, NJB, NLT, NRSV): you heard and understood the gospel in truth. You learned it from [[Epaphras]].
	3. It indicates manner (Alford, ICC, Lange, Meyer, NICNT): you heard and understood the gospel in truth, which is the way you learned it from [[Epaphras]]. [[Paul]] thus confirms and approves [[Epaphras]]’ teaching.
	4. It indicates reason (causal clause) by which the Colossians hear and recognized the grace of God (Campbell 5)
	5. It indicates amplification: you heard and learned the gospel in truth, that is, as you were taught it by [[Epaphras]]
	6. It indicates equivalence: you heard and understood the gospel in truth; it is what you learned from [[Epaphras]].
- What is the implicit object of ἐμάθετε ‘learned’?
	1. Its object is the gospel: you learned the gospel.
		- This is a summary/complexive/constative aorist (BDF §332; Burton §§38–40, “historical aorist”; Robertson 831–34; Turner 72; Zerwick §§253–55, “global aorist”) that conceives of the initial learning of the gospel by the Colossians (= hearing about and coming to know God’s grace, v. 6) as a single whole, although prolonged instruction by [[Epaphras]] was undoubtedly involved. 
		- “(This was) just as you learned it,” “You were taught this” (NEB), i.e., the Colossians had learned about the grace of God, the gospel, “in untravestied form” (ἐν ἀληθείᾳ, v. 6). 
	2. Its object is grace: you learned the grace of God.

ἀπὸ Ἐπαφρᾶ

- Ἀπό + genitive stands for παρά + genitive after μανθάνω (Turner 258–59). Greek names ending in -ᾶς, such as Ἐπαφρᾶς, have -ᾶ in the genitive (MH 119; R 254–55). 
- Although Ἐπαφρᾶς is a shortened form of Ἐπαφρόδιτος (BDAG 493.3; MH 314; MM 230; BDF §125[1]; Robertson 172), this [[Epaphras]], a native or inhabitant of [[Colossae]] who founded the Colossian church (1:7; 4:12; Phlm 23), is not to be identified with the Epaphroditus of Phil 2:25; 4:18, who was probably a native of Philippi (cf. Lightfoot 29–36).

τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ συνδούλου ἡμῶν

- Genitive, in apposition to Ἐπαφρᾶ. On an articular substantive in apposition to an anarthrous proper noun (here Ἐπαφρᾶ), see 4:9. 
- Who is the implied actor of ἀγαπητοῦ ‘beloved’?
	1. The implied actors are [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]]: whom [[Timothy]] and I love
	2. The implied actors are [[Paul]] and his colleagues: whom my colleagues and I love
	3. The implied actor is [[Paul]]: whom I love
- [[Epaphras]], like [[Paul]] (συν-), was a slave (δοῦλος) of Christ (σύνδουλος, -ου, ὁ, fellow slave; so NAB2, HCSB, NET; Dunn 64); not simply “fellow-servant” (Wilson 76) or “co-worker” (NLT). Cf. Phlm 23, where [[Epaphras]] is described as a prisoner, along with [[Paul]] (συναιχμάλωτος), “in the service of Christ Jesus” (cf. G. Kittel, TDNT 1:196–97). The implied master is Christ.
	- [[Paul]] and [[Epaphras]] were involved in the same work. [[Epaphras]]' close relationship with [[Paul]] and his similar position should generate respect for him. It also indicates that [[Epaphras]]' work was with authority.
- On ἀγαπητός (“dear,” “dearly loved”), see Turner, _Words_ 266–68.
- To whom does the first person plural pronoun ἡμῶν ‘our’ refer?
	1. It refers to [[Paul]]: my beloved fellow servant.
	2. It refers to [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]]: [[Timothy]]'s and my beloved fellow servant.
	3. It refers to [[Paul]] and his colleagues: the beloved fellow servant of my colleagues and me.
- ἡμῶν. Genitive of relationship.

ὅς ἐστιν πιστὸς ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν διάκονος τοῦ Χριστοῦ

- ὅς. Nominative subject of ἐστιν.
- ἐστιν. 3 singular present active indicative.
	- Imperfective aspect implicates a stative Aktionsart.
- πιστὸς... διάκονος. Predicate nominative.
- As in 1:2 and 4:7, πιστός here means “trustworthy, faithful” rather than “believing.” 
- To whom was [[Epaphras]] faithful?
	1. He was faithful to Christ: a faithful servant of Christ
	2. He was faithful to [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]]: a servant of Christ who is [[Timothy]]'s and my faithful helper.
	3. He was faithful to the Colossians: a servant of Christ who is faithfully working for your benefit.
- Τοῦ Χριστοῦ 
	1. Preferred: objective genitive (“a faithful servant/agent (BDAG 230c,d) of Christ,” i.e., one “who is faithfully serving Christ”)
	2. possessive genitive (“Christ’s faithful servant”) (Campbell 6)
- Because διάκονος is anarthrous and Χριστοῦ is articular, Robertson proposes (on the basis of the “canon of Apollonius”—see on v. 5 above) the translation “a (faithful) minister of the Christ” (Robertson 781; sim. TCNT). But the use of the articular with proper names is notoriously irregular. [[Epaphras]] was serving Christ.
	- Alternate Option: [[Epaphras]] was serving [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]] by working in their stead at Colosse: who serves [[Timothy]] and me by working among you.
- The first and second editions of the UBS text favored the reading ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν, with a “C” rating, but the third edition favors ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν with a “C” rating, as also the fourth edition with a “B” rating (“almost certain”); so also NAB2, NRSV, NLT (“he is helping us in your place”), ESV; see Metzger 552–53. 
	- If only transcriptional probability were considered, ὑμῶν might appear the more probable textual reading, since the preceding ἡμῶν and the following ἡμῖν could have prompted a change from ὑμῶν to ἡμῶν {but, on the contrary, note the possible influence of ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν (4:12), also in reference to [[Epaphras]], for the opposite change}. 
	- However, the variant ἡμῶν seems preferable (so also Dunn 54 and n. 6; O’Brien 15–16; Lightfoot 134, 248–49; Wilson 76, 95–96; TNIV, NET) on the basis of both (1) external evidence and (2) intrinsic probability.
	- The witnesses supporting ὑμῶν are admittedly geographically diversified (including strong support from the versions and the Greek and the Latin Fathers). But the proto-Alexandrian (𝔓46 ℵ* A B) and Western (D G) witnesses for ἡμῶν make a formidable combination.
	- In the context [[Paul]] is confirming the authenticity of the message and the messenger known by the Colossians. [[Epaphras]] had worked in [[Colossae]] and elsewhere in the Lycus Valley (4:12–13), as now in Rome, as [[Paul]]’s representative (cf. Acts 19:10), acting on [[Paul]]’s behalf (ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν) or perhaps in his place (where ὑπέρ = ἀντί; cf. Z §91; Harris 1196–97). Scribes often confused the plurals of first and second person pronouns; in Modern Greek η and υ are pronounced alike (“ee,” as in feet; see Moulton Howard 73, 79).
- What relationship is indicated by ὑπέρ ‘on behalf of?
	1. Following the reading ‘on our behalf’, it indicates that [[Epaphras]] was acting on behalf of [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]], and [[Paul]]’s companions: who is a faithful minister to you on our behalf. In a sense he was doing [[Paul]]’s work. [[Paul]] being the apostle to the Gentiles. [[Epaphras]] was working in Colosse in place of [[Paul]] and [[Paul]]’s companions.
	2. Following the reading ‘on your behalf’, it indicates that [[Epaphras]]’ work was connected with the Colossians (KJV, NLT, NRSV). 
		- He was helping the Colossians for their benefit: he serves Christ by helping you. The Colossians benefited from his faithful service to Christ.
		- He was helping [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]] on behalf of the Colossians: he is helping us in your place.

### Col 1:8

ὁ καὶ δηλώσας ἡμῖν τὴν ὑμῶν ἀγάπην

- Nominative singular masculine (agreeing with ὅς, which refers to [[Epaphras]]) of the aorist active participle of δηλόω, give information to someone (dat., here ἡμῖν) about something (accusative, here τὴν . . . ἀγάπην; BDAG 222c). 
- The articular participle ὁ . . . δηλώσας (literally “the one who informed”), here emphasized by καί (“indeed”; although καί may mean “also” here, as NASB2, TNIV; Wilson 76), is equivalent to a relative clause, ὃς ἐδήλωσεν, “who informed” (cf. ὅς ἐστιν in v. 7b; and Burton §142; Robertson 764, 859). 
- “He is the one who informed us of your love” (sim. NAB1). 
- A possessive pronoun such as ὑμῶν may stand before, between (as here), or after the article and the noun that it qualifies (Robertson 779). Since the object of the Colossians’ love is not specified, it might be “all God’s people” (v. 4), all people (cf. 1 Thess 3:12), [[Paul]] (esp. if ὑμῶν is read in v. 7b), [[Epaphras]], Christ, or God—or all six.
- It was the recent news about the Colossian church that [[Epaphras]] had brought to [[Paul]] in prison in Rome—news of their faith and love (vv. 4, 8) as well as of the danger confronting them in the false teaching—that prompted the apostle to write the present letter. 
- It was Tychicus, not [[Epaphras]], who delivered the letter to [[Colossae]] (4:7–9); [[Epaphras]] remained with [[Paul]] (4:12; Phlm 23).

ἐν πνεύματι

- In [[Paul]]’s letters, there is often uncertainty whether πνεῦμα refers to the human spirit, to God’s Spirit, or to the human spirit renewed by God’s Spirit. 
- Here, the sense is not “(your love) in your spirit(s)” (locative ἐν), i.e., “your spiritual love,” but “(your love) inspired by the Spirit” (instrumental ἐν; Campbell 6; TCNT; BDAG 835b), or “(the love) the Spirit has awakened in you” (REB), or “(your love,) which is a gift of the Spirit” (Barth-Blanke 1). 
- In Rom 15:30 the same idea is expressed, after ἡ ἀγάπη, by τοῦ πνεύματος, a subjective genitive, “love engendered by the Spirit” (cf. Rom 5:5; Gal 5:22).
