## [[Paul]]'s Intercession For the Colossians (1:9–14)
- Like vv. 3–8, these six verses form one sentence in Greek, although most editions of the Greek text print a semicolon after v. 12 (as also after v. 6).

### Col 1:9

Διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἡμεῖς
- Διὰ τοῦτο (causal) means “because of this,” “this/that is why,” and refers back to vv. 4–8, the encouraging news [[Epaphras]] had brought to [[Paul]] about the Colossians. 
- Καί here means “also” (cf. Zerwick §462) and belongs with the verb: not only did [[Paul]] offer thanksgiving to God for the Colossians (v. 3), but he “also” constantly interceded for them. The news prompted intercession (v. 9) as well as thanksgiving (vv. 3–4). This correlation use establishes a mutual relationship of items of equal status.
- But Moule (Col. 52) links καί with διὰ τοῦτο: “that is precisely why,” while others render καὶ ἡμεῖς by “we, for our part” (Cassirer; similarly Wilson 98). 
- ἡμεῖς. Nominative subject of παυόμεθα.

ἀφ̓ ἧς ἡμέρας ῆκούσαμεν
- ἀφ̓ ἧς ἡμέρας. Temporal, indicating the point from which something begins. (Campbell 6)
- ῆκούσαμεν. 1 plural aorist active indicative of ἀκούω, hear. 
	- Perfective aspect -> summary Aktionsart.
- “Ever since we heard [this].” 
	- The implied object of ἠκούσαμεν may be the Colossians’ faith and love (v. 4, note ἀκούσαντες) or their love inspired by the Spirit (v. 8). 
	- Accordingly some English translations prefer the undefined “about you” (CEV, NLT, TNIV) or “the good news about you” (Barth-Blanke 173).

οὐ παυόμεθα ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν προσευχόμενοι
- παυόμεθα, 1 plural present middle indicative of παύω, (cause to) stop; (mid.) cease. 
	- Imperfective aspect -> progressive Aktionsart.
- Προσευχόμενοι (nominative plural masculine of present middle participle of deponent προσεύχομαι, pray) is a predicate participlate (Turner 158–59), completing the sense of παυόμεθα: “we do not cease/we have not ceased praying for you” = “we pray for you without ceasing” (cf. BDAG 790b; NAB2), “we have continued praying for you” (NLT). 
- This refers to prayer that is regular and frequent rather than uninterrupted. 

καὶ αἰτούμενοι
- Nominative plural masculine (agreeing with the subject of παυόμεθα) of present middle participle of αἰτέω, ask, ask for; a second predicate participle after οὐ παυόμεθα. 
- This may be a case of hendiadys: “praying for you and asking” = “asking in our prayers for you” (so also Mark 11:24, “whatever you ask in prayer”; cf. ZG 603; Z §460). 
- Some scholars attempt to distinguish the active and middle senses of αἰτέω, the active meaning “ask outright” or denoting the mere formality of prayer, and the middle meaning “ask as a loan” or signifying a request made in the true spirit of prayer. But no such distinctions are consistently maintained in the NT, where αἰτέω and αἰτέομαι alternate almost arbitrarily (see BDF §316[2]; BDAG 30b; G. Stählin, TDNT 1:192; H. Schönweiss, NIDNTT 2:856–57; Turner, Insights 163–64).

ἵνα πληρωθῆτε τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ
- The ἵνα + subjunctive clause indicates the content of the petition rather than its purpose (Wallace 475; cf. BDAG 476b and 4:3–4, but Barth-Blanke 173 allege [improbably] that ἵνα here specifies both content and purpose). 
- πληρωθῆτε. 2 plural aorist passive subjunctive of πληρόω, fill. 
- God is the implied agent of the action since the request is addressed to him (cf. REB, “We ask God that you may receive from him full insight into his will”; G. Delling, TDNT 6:291). 
- “Our request is that God may fill you” (sim. GNB, TNIV). 
- Πληρόω is usually followed by a genitive of content (e.g., Rom 15:14, “filled with all knowledge”) but here, exceptionally, an accusative denoting content is found (see Turner 247; Robertson 483). 
- Alternatively, but less probably, τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν could be an accusative of reference or respect (cf. BDF §160; Z §74): “that you may be filled with respect to the knowledge of God’s will.”
- Ἐπίγνωσις (ἐπί + γνῶσις), -εως, ἡ, may mean “complete understanding,” “clear knowledge” (Weymouth), “deeper knowledge” (TCNT), or “ever-growing knowledge” (Barclay; intensive or perfective ἐπί; cf. R 600; Robertson, Pictures 475; sim. Lightfoot 136), but this compound noun need not signify more than γνῶσις (cf. R. Bultmann, TDNT 1:704–8). 
- Indeed, after a detailed discussion of the issue (pp. 248–54), J. A. Robinson concludes that γνῶσις is the wider word, “knowledge” in the fullest sense and in the abstract, ἐπίγνωσις expressing knowledge directed toward (ἐπί) a particular object that, if expressed, is indicated by the objective genitive (St. Paul’s Epistle to the Ephesians [London: Macmillan, 19282], 254), namely, τοῦ θελήματος in v. 9 and τοῦ θεοῦ in v. 10. 
	- See also the discussion of ἐπέγωτε in 1:6 and K. Sullivan, “Epignosis in the Epistles of St. Paul,” Studiorum Paulinorum Congressus Internationalis Catholicus 1961 (Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1963), 2.405–16. 

ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει πνευματικῇ
- This prepositional phrase may be taken in three ways:
	1. with πληρωθῆτε, ἐν being instrumental or manner: “filled . . . by having” (Campbell 7; NEB, NJB, NAB2)
	2. with ἐπίγνωσιν, ἐν being sociative: “knowledge . . . accompanied by” (Weymouth), “knowledge  . . .  such as brings with it” (Cassirer)
	3. with ἐπίγνωσιν, ἐν being epexegetic: “knowledge . . . which consists in” (Moule 53, GNB).
	- Option #1 preferred: πληρωθῆτε is followed by a statement, first of content, then of means: “that you may be filled with the knowledge of God’s will by having spiritual wisdom and discernment (σύνεσις, -εως, ἡ) in full measure.” With an anarthous noun, πᾶς means “every” or “all” in the sense of “every kind of” (BDF §275[3]; Robertson 771–72; Turner 199–200; Zerwick §§188–91) or “all” in the sense of “the highest degree of,” “total” (elative πᾶς); see B. Reicke, TDNT 5:887–88; cf. BDAG 783d; Barth-Blanke 176–177. 
- For πᾶς with an articular noun, see on 1:4. 
- Both adjectives πάσῃ and πνευματικῇ should be construed with both nouns σοφίᾳ and συνέσει (Wilson 102, “probably”). 
- Πνευματικός here signifies “relating to the (human) spirit/spiritual matters” or (as BDAG 837a proposes; GNB, TNIV; G. Schrenk, TDNT 3:58) “given by the Spirit,” in comparison with the specious wisdom of the false teaching (2:23) that emanated from an unspiritual mind (2:18).

### Col 1:10

περιπατῆσαι ἀξίως τοῦ κυρίου
- Aorist active infinitive of περιπατέω, walk; (in a moral sense) live, behave (BDAG 803a; H. Seesemann, TDNT 5:944; Dunn 71). 
	- The metaphor of “walking” to denote life-conduct is “untypical of Greek thought … but characteristically Jewish” (Dunn, 71; see Exod 18:20; Deut 13:4–5; Ps 86:11; Prov 28:18; Isa 33:15; 1QS 5:10).
	- This infinitive is a constative aorist (see v. 7) that views the Christian’s whole life and conduct as a unit, without reference to an individual or repeated acts (as is expressed by τὸ περιπατεῖν in 1 Thess 2:12), although BDF §337(1) sees the περιπατῆσαι as highlighting the newness of the Christian’s life. 
	- This infinitive may express purpose (after πληρωθῆτε κτλ.), “in order that you may lead a life” (so O’Brien 18, 22; Robertson 1049, 1087; NASB2, HCSB, ESV; Barth-Blanke 173; Wilson 98)
	- This infinitive may express a result, “you will then lead a life” (Lightfoot 137;  TCNT, GNB, NJB, NLT). 
	- It is unlikely to express additional content of the request, “asking that you may be filled . . . and may lead a life.” 
- [[Paul]]’s prayer, then, was in essence that the Colossians would have “all spiritual wisdom and discernment,” which would mean that they were “filled with the knowledge of God’s will” and thus would “lead a life worthy of the Lord.”
- Ἀξίως (adverb), “in a manner worthy of,” with genitive of the person or thing. 
- Although God the Father is the implied agent in πληρωθῆτε and αὐτοῦ in v. 9 and 11, τοῦ κυρίου here probably denotes the Lord Jesus (as also BDAG 578b), given the following explicit references to τοῦ θεοῦ (v. 10b) and τῷ πατρί (v. 12a) and [[Paul]]’s customary distinction (Zerwick §169) between ὁ Κύριος = Christ and Κύριος = Yahweh.

εἰς πᾶσαν ἀρεσκείαν
- Literally “to every type of pleasing.” 
- On anarthrous πᾶς, see 1:9. 
- Since this phrase follows “worthy of the Lord (Jesus)” as a second qualification of περιπατῆσαι, it will mean “to please him in all respects” (BDAG 129c) or “that seeks to please him in everything/to be wholly pleasing to him,” with εἰς denoting purpose. 
	- Alternative view: Result. While this could indicate purpose, it is better understood as the result of the purpose infinitive περιπατῆσαι, since it is natural to read “so that you fully please him” as a direct consequence of walking worthily of the Lord. (Campbell 7–8)
- Barth-Blanke 177–78 see the object of the ἀρεσκεία as people as well as the Lord God and the Lord Jesus. 
- In Classical Greek, ἀρεσκεία, -ας, ἡ, generally had a pejorative sense, “obsequiousness,” “cringing” (cf. MH 75).

ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ καρποφοροῦντες
- ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ. Circumstance under which _bearing fruit_ takes place.
- καρποφοροῦντες. Nominative plural masculine, the present active participle of καρποφορέω, bear fruit, yield a harvest (see 1:6 for middle use). 
- This participle agrees with the subject of πληρωθῆτε, although we might have expected this and the following three participles to be in the accusative in agreement with the implied subject of the infinitive περιπατῆσαι (cf. Eph 4:1–3). 
- On anarthrous πᾶς, see 1:9. 
- Both adjectives, παντί and ἀγαθῷ, qualify ἔργῳ: “every kind of good deed,” “right action of every sort” (Weymouth). 
	- But if ἔργῳ is a generic singular (see BDF §139; Turner 22–23), the meaning will be “good deeds of every kind” (Zerwick, Analysis 447; cf. BDAG 784c). 
- Καρποφοροῦντες is the first of four present participles in vv. 10–12 (the others are αὐξανόμενοι, δυναμούμενοι, εὐχαριστοῦντες) that modify περιπατῆσαι . . . ἀρεσκείαν and are circumstantial, describing four characteristics of “a life that is worthy of the Lord and that seeks to please him in every way”
- TNIV appropriately places a colon after “in every way.” 
- These four traits—bearing fruit, growing, being empowered, giving thanks—are portrayed as typical of the believer, not as the only marks of the Christian. 
- Each of the four participles is modified by a prepositional phrase. All four participles are in effect coordinate, although the last two lack a connective (a case of asyndeton). 
- Barth-Blanke take these four participles as imperatives (178–85), although this is not reflected in their translations.

καὶ αὐξανόμενοι τῇ ἐπιγνώσει τοῦ θεοῦ
- Nominative plural masculine (agreeing with the subject of πληρωθῆτε) of the present passive participle of αὐξάνω, grow, cause to grow; (passive) grow. 
- In v. 6 this verb denotes extensive growth; here, intensive growth (E. Schweizer, TDNT 7:1078n501). 
- Dative τῇ ἐπιγνώσει (on the meaning of this word see on 1:9) expresses the sphere of the growth (“growing in the knowledge,” locative dative or dative of respect, as Campbell 8) rather than its means (“growing by the knowledge,” instrumental dative, as Dunn 72n16). 
- Τοῦ θεοῦ is an objective genitive, “the knowledge of God(’s person),” not a subjective genitive (“the knowledge [of his will] imparted by God”). 
	- On this view, v. 10b is an instance of chiasmus (A–B–B–A): 
		- (A) a prepositional phrase in the dative (ἐν παντὶ κτλ.) modifying (B) a present participle (καρποφοροῦντες)
		- (B) a present participle (αὐξανόμενοι) modified by (A) a dative phrase (τῇ ἐπιγνώσει κτλ.). 
	- But it is also possible (thus Lohse 29) to construe both modifying phrases with both participles: “bearing fruit and growing in every good deed through knowing God,” τῇ ἐπιγνώσει in that case being an instrumental dative expressing means.

### Col 1:11

ἐν πάσῃ δυνάμει δυναμούμενοι
- δυναμούμενοι. Nominative plural masculine (agreeing with the subject of πληρωθῆτε) of the present passive participle of δυναμόω, strengthen, empower. 
- This is the third of four circumstantial present participles in vv. 10–12 
- Ἐν is instrumental, literally “(being empowered) with all power.” 
	- BDAG proposes “equipped with all power” (262c) or “endowed with all capability” (263d). 
- Πάσῃ δυνάμει may signify “power of every kind” (Zerwick Grosvenor 603; e.g., 1:9) or “with full power” (cf. BDAG 783d, πᾶς denoting the “highest degree”).

κατὰ τὸ κράτος τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ
- The preposition κατά may express:
	1. conformity (“in accordance with”; “according to,” RV, RSV, NASB2; Wilson 98), in which case κατὰ κτλ. points to the level of the resources available for the equipping with power
	2. basis (“based on [his own glorious power],” JB)
	3. cause (“as a result of,” “because of,” “that comes from” (NRSV), and thus “through”; see BDAG 513a), in which case the ἐν phrase denotes that with which the Colossians are empowered and the κατά phrase, that through which they are empowered: God’s glorious strength (κράτος, -ους, τό) imparts the power with which they are endued or empowers them with a full measure of power (cf. NAB1, “By the might of his glory”; Moffatt, “May his glorious might nerve you with full power”).
- Genitive τῆς δόξης 
	1. possessive, “that belongs to/is characteristic of his glory (= majesty or divinity),” “the might of his glory” (Wilson 98, 109)
	2. qualitative, describing τὸ κράτος as “glorious might” (BDAG 565b) or “majestic power” (BDAG 257b).
- αὐτοῦ. Possessive genitive.

εἰς πᾶσαν ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν
- Εἰς indicates the goal (purpose), “for,” “with a view to,” “so that you will have,” “for the attaining of” (NASB2), “for the display of” (NET); see, however, A. Oepke, TDNT 2:429. 
- Ὑπομονή, -ῆς, ἡ, is resolute endurance under difficult circumstances, while μακροθυμία, -ας, ἡ, is patient endurance that does not retaliate (see Lightfoot 138; J. Horst, TDNT 4:384n82; Barth-Blanke 182). 
- On anarthrous πᾶς, see 1:9
- Translation: “for endurance and patience of every kind/in every way,” or “great endurance and patience” (TNIV; cf. BDAG 783d), “always to persevere and endure” (NJB).

μετὰ χαρᾶς
- Manner.
- This phrase (“with joy”) may stand alone, “May you be filled with joy” (NLT), “being filled with joy” (Cassirer), but probably is to be construed with what precedes (εἰς πᾶσαν κτλ.; so WH; ESV; Barth-Blanke 183) or with what follows (εὐχαριστοῦντες κτλ.; so UBS, with a comma before μετά [UBS1–3], or with a full stop before μετά [UBS3 corrected, 4]). 
	- In favor of the latter construction (“joyfully giving thanks,” NIV, NAB2, NRSV; sim. O’Brien 25; Wilson 98, 110) is the precise parallel in Phil 1:4 and the structure of the sentence (namely, four participles, each modified by a phrase; see above on Structure). 
- Nestle-Aland 27 begins a new sentence and paragraph with μετὰ χαρᾶς.

### Col 1:12

εὐχαριστοῦντες τῷ πατρί
- εὐχαριστοῦντες. Nominative plural masculine (agreeing with the subject of πληρωθῆτε) of the present active participle of εὐχαριστέω, give thanks; followed by the dative (τῷ πατρί). 
- This participle is the last of four circumstantial participles that modify περιπατῆσαι κτλ. (v. 10) and refer to the Colossians. 
- It is also possible, although unlikely, that εὐχαριστοῦντες is to be taken with οὐ παυόμεθα (v. 9) and refers to [[Paul]] and [[Timothy]] (v. 1) (“we have not ceased praying . . . asking . . . giving thanks”) or that the participle is imperative (so Lohse 32 and n. 1; cf. BDF §468[2]).
- τῷ πατρί. Dative complement of εὐχαριστοῦντες.
- The unusual absolute use of ὁ πατήρ seems to have led some copyists to add the qualification τοῦ Χριστοῦ (“the Father of Christ”) and others to add (τῷ) θεῷ before (καὶ)/(τῷ) πατρί (“God the Father”). See UBS and Metzger 553.

τῷ ἱκανώσαντι ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν μερίδα
- ἱκανώσαντι. Dative singular masculine of the aorist active participle of ἱκανόω, make fit, enable, qualify (someone for something, τινὰ εἴς τι [BDAG 473a]; here ὑμᾶς εἰς). 
	- While adjectival, the aorist participle (conveying perfective aspect) is nevertheless capable of expressing antecedent activity. In this case, the participle refers to the Father’s previous action of enabling the Colossians to share in the inheritance of the saints. (Campbell 8)
- This articular participle is in apposition to τῷ πατρί (T 206), literally “the one who (has) qualified you. 
- ὑμᾶς. Accusative direct object. Some manuscripts attest ἡμᾶς (A C D F G Ψ 075) rather than ὑμᾶς (א B 104 365 629), but this is likely an assimilation to ἡμᾶς in the following verse.
- Εἰς states the goal of God’s action (“for a share,” “to obtain a share,” “to receive our share,” Weymouth), or possibly simply denotes reference (“with respect to,” so BDAG 291a). 
- The article with μερίς, -ίδος, ἡ (“allotted portion,” “part,” “share”) may be possessive, “your share.”
- As well as having strong Alexandrian support (ℵ B 1739), the textual reading ὑμᾶς is to be preferred (so also Wilson 98, 112) because it would readily have been altered to ἡμᾶς to conform with ἡμᾶς in v. 13a and because scribes naturally tended to make statements that were true of all Christians (v. 12b), applicable to readers and writers alike (ἡμᾶς). Similar textual issues arise in 2:13 (ὑμᾶς . . . ἡμῖν).

τοῦ κλήρου τῶν ἁγίων
- Κλῆρος,-ου, ὁ, means “(apportioned) lot, inheritance.” 
- τοῦ κλήρου. This genitive, which is dependent on τὴν μερίδα, could be epexegetic (“the portion which consists in the lot,” Lightfoot 139) but is probably partitive (“a share in the inheritance,” BDAG 548c, 633a; “to share the inheritance”; Campbell 9). On the partitive genitive, see BDF §164, 169; Moule 42–43; Robertson 502; Turner 208–10. 
- τῶν ἁγίων. Possessive, “the inheritance belonging to/reserved for/intended for/that awaits God’s people.” 
	- Some commentators argue that οἱ ἅγιοι here refers to angels, “the holy ones” (e.g., Wilson 112–14; also BDAG 11c), but this is improbable.
	- Elsewhere in this letter οἱ ἅγιοι denotes believers (1:2, 4, 26; e.g., 1:22; 3:12), and this meaning is certainly possible here, given the common Pauline concept of the believers’ inheritance 
	- The ideas of v. 12b are paralleled in two Lukan summaries of Pauline speeches (Acts 20:32; and esp. 26:18), where the reference is to believers, not angels. See further Barth-Blanke 185–86 (who take οἱ ἅγιοι to refer to Jews; see also 186, 194); Dunn 76–77.
- In the OT, the “inheritance” of Israel was the land God gave to them (Num 26:53; Deut 4:21; Josh 11:23; 1 Kgs 8:36, etc.). Whereas once this inheritance was land, and only promised to the people of Israel, it is now “in light” and available also to Gentiles (Woodhouse, 48–49). (Campbell 9)

ἐν τῷ φωτί
- This prepositional phrase could be construed with:
	1. τοῦ κλήρου—“the inheritance . . . that consists of the kingdom of light” (epexegetic ἐν) or (“that is [τοῦ]) in the realm of light” (REB), “in Light” (NASB2) (locative ἐν); cf. v. 5.
	2. τῷ ἱκανώσαντι—“who has qualified you . . . by his light (= the gospel)” (instrumental ἐν)
	3. τῶν ἁγίων—“God’s people who are in the kingdom of light,” “who live in the light” (NLT), “dwellers in a realm of light” (Cassirer) (locative ἐν)
- In view of the contrast with “the dominion/realm of darkness” (v. 13a), articular φωτί probably means “the realm/kingdom of light” (e.g., 3:1; Eph 1:20), which is further defined in v. 13b as “the kingdom of his [God’s] dearly loved Son” and therefore refers to a present reality (cf. ἔχομεν in v. 14). 
- On the φῶς vs. σκότος/σκοτία contrast, see Barth-Blanke 225–26; Wilson 114–15.

### Col 1:13

ὃς ἐρρύσατο ἡμᾶς
- ἐρρύσατο. 3 singular aorist middle indicative of ῥύομαι, rescue, deliver (someone from something, τινὰ ἔκ/ἀπό τινος). 
	- Perfective aspect -> summary Aktionsart.
- The rescue and transference (μετέστησεν, v. 13b) occurred either at the death of Christ (in a collective and proleptic sense) or at the individual believer’s conversion. 
	- On either view, the aorists are constative, viewing an act or successive acts as a whole (cf. v. 7). 
- Ἡμᾶς refers to [[Paul]], [[Timothy]], and the addressees as typical of all believers. The change from 2 plural (ὑμᾶς, v. 12) to 1 plural (ἡμᾶς, v. 13) is not uncommon in [[Paul]] (e.g., 2:13–14; Rom 6:14–15). 
- Ὅς may be causal (cf. Robertson 960): “for He rescued us” (Barclay).

ἐκ τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ σκότους
- “From the dominion of darkness” (TNIV). 
- Ἐξουσία is a key word in Pauline and biblical theology. It is derived from ἔξεστι (“it is possible”) and has a wide range of meaning: (1) freedom of choice or of action; (2) arbitrary or delegated power exercised by a person; (3) the person thus empowered, a bearer of authority; and (4) the sphere or domain where that power or rule is exercised (cf. BDAG 352c–53d). 
	- Here it means (2) “power” or (4) “domain”; the English word “dominion” reproduces the ambiguity. Rather than simply saying “from darkness” (ἐκ τοῦ σκότους, which would be parallel to ἐν τῷ φωτί, v. 12b), [[Paul]] introduces ἐξουσία as a parallel to βασιλεία (v. 13b) and to show that the darkness was not merely a state but an active authority (A. S. Peake, EGT 3.501), “the dominion where darkness reigns” (Cassirer).
- After ἐκ τῆς ἐξουσίας the genitive τοῦ σκότους (from σκότος, -ους, τό, darkness) could be:
	- qualitative: “the dominion that is characterized by darkness”
	- possessive: “the power possessed by darkness” [here personified]
	- subjective: “the power exercised by [the prince of] darkness” (Campbell 9)
	- epexegetic: “the power which is Darkness”

καὶ μετέστησεν εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν
- μετέστησεν. 3 singular aorist active indicative of μεθίστημι, transfer, remove: “and transferred us [ἡμᾶς, from v. 13a] into the kingdom.” 
	- Aorist -> summary Aktionsart.
- Verse 13 describes two actions of God the Father (ὅς) that are sequential (first rescue, then transference) or, better, concurrent (rescue by transference). 
- With εἰς, the verb μεθίστημι can mean “transplant into” or “transport to” (of population resettlement; cf. BDAG 625b,c). 
- If the prefix μεθ- (= μετά) has special import with εἰς, the meaning will be “brought us away into” (NEB)/ “safe into” (GNB)/“over into” (Barclay). 
- This clause introduces the last of three grounds for thanksgiving to the Father (namely, vv. 12b, 13a, 13b).

τοῦ υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ
- An accumulation of genitives is typical of [[Paul]]. Literally “of the Son (possessive genitive) of the love (qualitative genitive) of him” (possessive genitive). 
	- Alternative: τοῦ υἱοῦ. Subjective genitive. (Campbell 9)
- It would seem that for [[Paul]] the kingdom of Christ was an alternative designation for the kingdom of God during the period between the resurrection of Christ and the arrival of the End (cf. 1 Cor 15:23–25; Eph 5:5; 2 Tim 4:1, 18; Matt 13:41). 
- τῆς ἀγάπης as a genitive:
	1. as qualitative (“beloved,” “dearly loved”; see on v. 5), the whole phrase being equivalent to τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ (cf. Mark 1:11) or τοῦ ἠγαπημένου υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ (cf. Eph 1:6; so Moule 175; Zerwick, Analysis 448; E. Schweizer, TDNT 8:369n246) and meaning “his [God’s] beloved Son” (BDAG 6d; cf. R 496) or “the Son he loves” (HCSB, TNIV). 
	2. of origin or source: “begotten of (the Father’s essence =) love” (Lightfoot 140, following Augustine). 
	3. TCNT renders “who is the embodiment of his love” (epexegetic genitive). 
- In this Semetic idiom the personal pronoun αὐτοῦ, which denotes possessive, properly belongs to τοῦ υἱοῦ but is actually attached to the dependent qualitative genitive (Turner 214; Turner, Style 91; Robertson 497; cf. Zerwick §41).
- The imagery of vv. 12–13 suggests that believers have been rescued from the gloomy domain and tyrannical rule of Satan by being transplanted as free colonists into the kingdom and peaceable sovereignty of Christ, to become citizens in the realm of light.

### Col 1:14

ἐν ᾧ ἔχομεν τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν
- This clause marks the transition from the recitation of three of God’s redemptive acts (vv. 12–13) to the celebration of Christ’s person and work (vv. 14–20) where three successive relative pronouns, ἐν ᾧ (v. 14), ὅς (v. 15), and ὅς (v. 18), and eleven instances of the personal pronoun αὐτός, all refer to Christ.
- Although the nearest antecedent to ἐν ᾧ is αὐτοῦ (= God the Father, as NLT), the actual antecedent is τοῦ υἱοῦ. 
- Ἐν is almost certainly locative, “in union with whom” (on the ἐν Χριστῷ concept, see on v. 2), although Goodspeed takes it as instrumental, “by whom we have been ransomed from captivity” as also Cassirer, “through whom we are being set free from our bondage.” 
	- Locative (Campbell 2012, 195). Redemption is located within the realm of Christ’s rule.
- After the three aorists in vv. 12–13, the present active indicative 1 plural ἔχομεν stresses the ongoing and permanent result of the Father’s threefold action: “we enjoy the possession of” (cf. NJB, “we enjoy our freedom”; Barth-Blanke 192, “freedom belongs to us”). 
	- Imperfective aspect -> stative Aktionsart.
- While it is improper to suggest that ἀπολύτρωσις, -εως, ἡ, always denotes “release from (ἀπό) bondage through the payment of a ransom (λύτρον),” here it does seem to mean “redemption” in the sense of release from bondage to sin, given the imagery of v. 13a and the reference to sins in v. 14b. 

τὴν ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν
- “Redemption” is defined here as “the forgiveness of sins, τὴν ἄφεσιν (ἄφεσις, -εως, ἡ; release, pardon, forgiveness) being accusative in epexegetic apposition to τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν. 
- Τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν is an objective genitive (cf. Eph 1:7), with the article probably denoting possessive, “our sins” (RV [“our redemption . . . our sins”], TCNT, REB [“our release . . . our sins”], GNB). 
- On the ἁμαρτ- word group, see Turner, Words 412–13; on ἄφεσις, ibid. 371.
