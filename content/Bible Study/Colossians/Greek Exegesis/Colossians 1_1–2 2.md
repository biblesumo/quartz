# Introductory Greeting (1:1–2)
### Col 1:1

Παῦλος ἀπόστολος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ διὰ θελήματος θεοῦ
- "[[Paul]]": as a proper name is anarthrous.
- "an apostle": in apposition with [[Paul]] with the nominative case.
	1. A general, nontechnical sense, of a messenger or emissary commissioned by people for a specific, temporary task.
	2. A semitechnical sense, of a Christian with a particular, permanent commission from Christ or the local church (Rom 16:7, Andronicus and Junia; 1 Cor 15:7 and Gal 1:19, James the brother of Jesus; 1 Cor 9:5–6, Barnabas by implication (cf. Acts 14:4, 14))
	3. A technical sense, of the Twelve (Matt 10:2; 1 Cor 15:5, 7) and [[Paul]] (1 Cor 9:1; 15:9), as commissioned directly by Christ for permanent and distinctive leadership in the universal church. 
- "of Christ Jesus" 
	- possessive genitive: "apostle belonging to Christ Jesus"
	- subjective genitive: one of agency "sent by Christ Jesus"
	- Χριστός = "Messiah" vs "Christ"
- "by the will of God"
	- The διά phrase qualifies ἀπόστολος, “an apostle . . . by the will of God (θεοῦ, possessive genitive).” God’s will was the means by which [[Paul]] was chosen to be an apostle (διά + gen.; BDAG 224d, “efficient cause”)

καὶ Τιμόθεος ὁ ἀδελφός
- "and [[Timothy]] our brother" 
	- The art. here (cf. anar. ἀπόστολος after Παῦλος above) indicates that [[Timothy]] was well known.
	- preferred over "your brother" or "my brother"
	- both a fellow Christian and a co-worker but not a fellow apostle.
- Why is [[Timothy]] mentioned?
	- Option A: He sent greetings along with [[Paul]]. He was [[Paul]]'s helper and co-worker. [[Paul]]'s companion. He was with [[Paul]]. He was in agreement/identified with the contents of the letter. He was known by the Colossians. He may have become acquainted with some of them when he was with [[Paul]] in Ephesus on the third missionary journey. He was probably known to them only by name and not personally. He was not a co-writer nor did he write the letter at [[Paul]]'s dictation.
	- Option B: He possibly wrote the letter as [[Paul]] dictated it.
	- Option C: He was the co-writer and possibly did the actual writing.
- What is meant by ἀδελφός "brother"?
	- It refers to Christian brotherhood. It means a fellow Christian, a member of the same spiritual family, a co-worker. It speaks of [[Timothy]]'s relationship as a Christian brother to both [[Paul]] and the Colossians.

### Col 1:2

τοῖς ἐν Κολοσσαῖς ἁγίοις
- "to the saints"
	- The addressees (indicated by the dat.) are οἱ ἅγιοι
- "in [[Colossae]]"
	- Idiomatic plural in nouns (Robertson p.408)
	- Some cities have plural names, as  Ἰεροσόλυμα (Mt 2:1),  Ἀθῆναι (Ac 17:16), Κολοσσαί (Col 1:2).
- What is meant by ἁγίοις "saints/holy"?
	- Option A: It is a noun meaning "saints": to the saints and faithful/believing brothers. They are God’s holy people, set apart for him, chosen by him to be his own people, consecrated/dedicated to him. The term does not refer to a state of advanced holiness. They are saints because of their relationship to God through Jesus and are to live godly lives. The conjunction καί ‘and’ indicates that the nouns it connects refer to the same people. The second term describes or specifies the first: to the saints, who are faithful brothers.
	- Option B: It is an adjective modifying "brothers": to the holy and faithful/believing brothers. They are God's own people, dedicated to him, committed and loyal to him.

 καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖ
- "and faithful"
	- Option A: it means “trustworthy,” “true,” or “faithful,” so it is unlikely that ἐν Χριστῷ is dependent on πιστοῖς (“the consecrated brothers who believe in Christ”), a sense that would seem to demand τοῖς 
	- Option B: πιστοῖς meant simply “believing” (so BDAG 821b; cf. NEB, “brothers in the faith”), it would be tautologous with ἁγίοις and ἀδελφοῖς.
	- Option C: It is a substantive meaning "believers": to the saints and believers, brothers in Christ.
- "brothers"
	- plural ἀδελφοί is not gender specific
	- It describes the relation of the believers to each other and speaks of the church as a family, a brotherhood. It means those who believe in Christ.
 
 ἐν Χριστῷ
- "in Christ"
	- the ἐν is more likely to express incorporation (“incorporate in the Body of Christ”) and/or union (“in union with the risen Christ”) than agency (“through the power of Christ”).
	- Option A: "in Christ" modifies "brothers": to the brothers in Christ.
	- Option B: "in Christ" is a further description of the recipients of the letter: to you who are saints and faithful brothers and who are in Christ.
 
 χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη
- "Grace to you and peace"
	- This distinctively Christian formula is related to the traditional Greek greeting (χαῖρε or χαίρειν, “greetings!”) and the customary Jewish greeting (_šlôm_, “peace!”)
	- Both nouns are anarthrous because this expression was stereotyped.
- What is meant by χάρις "grace"?
	- It was a greeting, adapted by the Christians from the traditional Greek greeting. It is similar to the common greeting used in letters, but with a much deeper meaning. It is God’s good will toward people, given without conditions. It is undeserved favor, love which forgives sins, the free gift of salvation and of Christian life and growth. In a salutation it probably refers to God blessing them or being kind to them, showing them His love or causing good to come to them.
- What is meant by εἰρήνη "peace"?
	- It was a greeting adapted by the Christians from the traditional Jewish greeting. It is the result of grace. It is a state in which one is at peace with God and with one another. It is reconciliation to God and spiritual wholeness, the salvation of the whole person, including both body and soul, peace in mind and heart, and all the blessings belonging to God’s people. It means to have the good life. It is a prayer that they more fully understand the nature of the peace God has established with them.

 ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν 
 - "from God our Father"
	- Unless the context makes it impossible (Jn 1:1; 20:28; Phil 3:19), θεός everywhere in the NT denotes the Father.
	- [[Paul]] here views “God, who is our Father,” as the source or origin (ἀπό + gen.) of Christian grace and peace.
