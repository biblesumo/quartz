## Geography
- Located in the Lycus Valley in the territory of Phrygia in the Roman province of Asia Minor about 120 miles east of Ephesus.
	- 11 miles southeast of [[Laodicea]] and 15 miles SSE of Hierapolis. Both are more important cities than Colossae during the time of the Apostle [[Paul]].

## History
- In 480 BC, Herodotus (Histories 7.30.1 LCL) refers to Colossae as "a great city of Phrygia" though he is inaccurate in his description of its location. 
- Some scholars believed that 1st century AD Colossae had greatly diminished in size and importance. It was overshadowed by [[Laodicea]] which became the most prominent city of Lycus Valley by the Roman imperial period.
	- "Colossae was not an important cultural center such as Alexandria, Athens or Rome. In fact, Colessae was a rather insignificant city in Roman times, eclipsed by its neighbor [[Laodicea]]. Most of the people of Colosaae would have made their living by raising sheep, by farming crops, or by wool-dyeing." (Arnold p.4)
	- Economic success of Lycus Valley was from textile industries.
	- In the first century BC, Colossae is referred as a small town (Strabo, Geography 12.8.13). Colossae was famous for distinctive purple color (or dark red dyed) of its wool (Geography 12.8.16).
- Some estimated 7,500-10,000 Jewish freemen in Lycus Valley based on temple tax (Cic. Flac. 28.68)
	- Jewish settlement originated sometime in the early 2nd century BC when Babylonian Jews were brought into the area (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 12.147–153)
- Severe earthquake rocked this region either in AD 60 (Tac. Ann. 14.27) or in AD 64 (Eusebius)
- Colossae has never been excavated, although it's possible that excavation is imminent.

## Church History
- Probably evangelized during [[Paul]]'s residence in Ephesus, when "all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord" (Acts 19:10).
	- Alternative theory is that Phrygians were in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:10) and brought Christinity to the area upon their return home.
- Unlikely that [[Paul]] had visited the city before he wrote Colossians, but his desire to visit the city may have occurred after his release from prison (Phlm 22; 2 Tim 2:20)
- Both Philemon and Onesimus were inhabitants of Colossae (Col 4:9; Phlm 10) as were Archippus and Apphia.
- Philemon had hosted the Colossian church in his home (Phil 1:1–2).
