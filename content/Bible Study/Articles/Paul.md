	- Joined a venture already begun by the Damascus church.
	- Gal 4:25; Acts 2:11; Rom 15:19; Clem 25:1, 3)
	- Paul initially did not consult with the other apostles in Jerusalem

	- The Jerusalem church had sent Barnabas to Antioch where he became the leading figure among the Jewish Christians from Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Syria/Cilicia.
	- Barnabas looks for Paul in Tarsus and brings him to Antioch (Acts 11:25–26)
	- In Antioch, the mission to the Greeks was born (Acts 11:20) and the name "Christian" (*Christianoi*) first came into use (Acts 11:26).
- Paul went to Jerusalem a second time "after fourteen years" (Gal 2:1–10; Acts 11:27–30; 12:25)

	- The mission was divided into two thrusts
		- Jews (under the apostolate of Peter)
		- Other without official titles (Gal 2:8–9) under the leadership of Paul and Barnabas
#### 6.2 Further Data Concerning Mission to Galatia
- Letter presupposes the founding of the Galatian churches.
- If the founding visit is correlated with Acts 16:6, it can also be coordinated with Gal 4:13. Paul's second visit would be the one mentioned in Acts 18:23.
- Founding of the Galatian churches must have preceded 1 Corinthians, since he mentions the Galatian churches and the collection for Jerusalem in 1 Cor 16:1–4.
#### 6.3 Second Missionary Journey (AD 50–52)
- Paul went through Phrygia, Galatia, and passing by Mysia, to Troas. 
- From there he goes to Macedonia, responding to the Macedonian vision.
- [[Timothy]] (Acts 16:1–4) and Silas (Acts 15:40) accompanied Paul. Verified by Paul's letters (1 Thes 1:1; 2 Thes 1:1)
- Sailed from Traos to Naepolis, the harbor of Philippi.
- Founded Philippi, the first church in Macedonia (Acts 16:11–40)
- Then Thessalonia (17:1–9), Berea (17:10–15), Athens (17:16–34; 1 Thes 3:1–2), and Corinth (18:1–17). 
- Paul then sails to Ephesus (18:18–21), then traveled down to Caesarea and Jerusalem, then Antioch. (18:22)
#### 6.4 Third Missionary Journey (AD 53–57)
- Antioch (Acts 18:23)
- Galatia and Phrygia (18:23)
- Ephesus (Acts 19)
- Troas (2 Cor 2:12-13)
- Paul went through Macedonia to Greece, that is Corinth (20:1–3)
- Jewish opponents prevented Paul going from Corinth to Syria directly (Acts 20:1–6). Instead, he returned to Macedonia (including Philippi) in Passover 57.
- Troas (20:6–12) 
- Paul sailed along the coast to Miletus where Paul said farewell to the Ephesian elders who met him there (20:13–38)
- Tyre (21:3–7)
- Caesarea (21:8–14)
- Jerusalem (21:15–23:32) (Pentecost 57)
#### 6.5 Trials in Jerusalem
- Paul's defense (in Hebrew) to the Jewish crowds (Acts 21:40–22:21)
- Next defense before Jewish high priests and Sanhedrin (Acts 22:30–23:11)
- 500 soldiers escorted Paul from Jerusalem to Caesarea under guard in Herod's praetorium (23:23–35) around AD 57–60.
- Paul's trial before Felix (24:1–27)
- Festus, King Agrippa and Queen Berenice (25:1–26:32)
#### 6.6 Journey to Rome
- Shipwrecked but survived at Malta (Acts 27)
- Stayed in Malta for three months (28:2–10)
- Paul lived in Rome for two years at his own expense (Acts 28:30–31) around AD 61–62.
#### 6.7 Death
- Since Paul likely died during the Neronian persecution (started AD 64/65), and since it is difficult to see how his house arrest could have lasted until then, it is most reasonable to infer that he was released after two years, and after a further spell of missionary activity was arrested again and imprisoned in Rome for the second and final time. That Paul’s life was brought to an end in Rome by the executioner’s sword may be confidently accepted (possibly as late as AD 67).
