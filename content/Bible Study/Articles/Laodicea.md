- City in the Lycus valley of SW Phrygia, hence called *Laodicea ad Lycum*.

### Hellenistic and Roman City
- Laodicea suffered severely from earthquakes. 
	- One is recorded in the principate of Augustus: the case for relieving the Laodiceans, with the people of Thyatira and Chios, was presented to the Roman senate by Tiberius, the emperor’s stepson (Suet. _Tib._ 8). 
	- A later earthquake in AD 60 devastated the area. Laodicea was destroyed, but was rebuilt from its own resources without state assistance (Tac. _Ann._ 14.27.1).
### Jewish Settlement
- Antiochus III (213 BC) settled 2,000 Jewish families by Babylonia in Lydia and Phrygia to stabilize (Josephus *Ant* 12.149)
- Half-shekel tax paid annually by male Jews in 62 BC, and over 9,000 half-shekels were collected in and around Laodicea.
### Church of Laodicea
- Evangelized with the other cities of the Lycus valley during Paul's Ephesian ministry (Acts 19:10) by [[Epaphras]] (Col 4:13)
- One of the seven churches of Asia addressed in Revelation (Rev 3:14–22).
	- Rebuked for allowing wealth and comfort enjoyed to blunt the edge of its Christian confession.
	- Spiritually "wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked."
