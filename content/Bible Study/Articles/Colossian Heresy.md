## Introduction
- No formal expositon of the "Colossian heresy"
- Character must be inferred from the counter-arguments in Colossians

## Characteristics
- False teaching seems to have been Jewish
	- Legal ordinances, circumcision, food regulations, the sabbath, new moon, and other prescriptions of the Jewish calendar.
	- Different than the straightforward Judaism the churches of Galatia had encountered.
- Phrygian development in which a local variety of Judaism had been fused with a philosophy of non-Jewish origin, an early and simple form of gnosticism.
	- Synagogues of Phrygia exposed to influence of Hellenistic speculation and religious syncretism. 
	- Jewish-Hellenistic syncretism could easily expand and modify itself to fit the general framework of the Christian story.
- Special place was given to angels, as agents both in creation and in giving of the law.
	- Angelic agency in creation appears in Philo. 
	- The angels through whom the law was given are described as "elemental beings" (*stoicheia*), a term used in the same sense in Galatians 4:3, 9.
	- All this was presented as an advanced teaching for a spiritual elite. 
	- The Colossian believers were urged to progress in wisdom and knowledge (*gnosis*), to explore the deeper mysteries by a series of successive initiations until they attained perfection (*teleiosis*)

## J.B. Lightfoot (1875)
-  Traces this species of Judiazing *gnosis* back to the Essenes.
- Essene Judiasm was "gnostic", characterized by the intellectual exclusiveness and speculative tenets of gnosticism
- This type of Jewish thought and practice had established itself in that area of Asia Minor in the apostolic age
- The Colossian heresy was a brand of gnostic Judaism
	1. It was clearly Jewish in its basis
	2. It was marked by several distinctive features of gnosticism; an intellectual élite (which insisted on wisdom, knowledge, etc.), cosmogonic speculation (with emphasis on angelic mediation, the _plērōma_, etc.), asceticism and calendrical regulations.
